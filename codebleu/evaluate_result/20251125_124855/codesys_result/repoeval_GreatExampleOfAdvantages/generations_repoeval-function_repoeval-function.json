[["It looks like you're working with a programming language or environment that uses function blocks, possibly in a context like PLC programming with IEC 61131-3 languages such as Structured Text (ST). In this context, a `FUNCTION_BLOCK` is used to define a reusable block of code with inputs, outputs, and internal logic.\n\nHere's a basic template for a `FUNCTION_BLOCK` named `Home` with placeholders for inputs, outputs, and internal variables:\n\n```plaintext\nFUNCTION_BLOCK Home\nVAR_INPUT\n    // Define input variables here\n    // Example: inputVar1 : DataType;\nEND_VAR\n\nVAR_OUTPUT\n    // Define output variables here\n    // Example: outputVar1 : DataType;\nEND_VAR\n\nVAR\n    // Define internal variables here\n    // Example: internalVar1 : DataType;\nEND_VAR\n\n// Add your logic here\n// Example: \n// outputVar1 := inputVar1 + internalVar1;\n\nEND_FUNCTION_BLOCK\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **VAR_INPUT**: This section is where you declare input variables that the function block will receive. These are typically values or signals that the block will process.\n\n- **VAR_OUTPUT**: This section is for output variables that the function block will produce. These are the results or signals that the block will send out after processing.\n\n- **VAR**: This section is for internal variables that are used within the function block. These variables are not accessible from outside the block and are used for internal calculations or state management.\n\n- **Logic**: After the variable declarations, you implement the logic of the function block. This is where you define how the inputs are processed to produce the outputs.\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholders with actual variable names and data types that are appropriate for your application. If you have specific logic or functionality in mind, you can implement it in the logic section of the function block."], ["It looks like you're trying to define a function block in a programming environment, possibly for a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) using a language like Structured Text (ST) in the IEC 61131-3 standard. The function block is named `MQTT_STUFF`, which suggests it might be related to handling MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol operations.\n\nHere's a basic outline of how you might expand this function block to include inputs, outputs, and internal logic for handling MQTT operations:\n\n```pascal\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MQTT_STUFF\nVAR_INPUT\n    BrokerAddress : STRING; // Address of the MQTT broker\n    Port : UINT;            // Port number for the MQTT broker\n    ClientID : STRING;      // Client ID for the MQTT connection\n    Topic : STRING;         // Topic to subscribe/publish\n    Payload : STRING;       // Payload for publishing\n    Connect : BOOL;         // Trigger to connect to the broker\n    Publish : BOOL;         // Trigger to publish a message\n    Subscribe : BOOL;       // Trigger to subscribe to a topic\nEND_VAR\n\nVAR_OUTPUT\n    Connected : BOOL;       // Status of the connection\n    MessageReceived : BOOL; // Indicates if a message is received\n    ReceivedPayload : STRING; // Payload of the received message\n    Error : BOOL;           // Error flag\n    ErrorCode : INT;        // Error code for diagnostics\nEND_VAR\n\nVAR\n    // Internal variables\n    ConnectionStatus : BOOL;\n    LastError : INT;\nEND_VAR\n\n// Logic for connecting to the MQTT broker\nIF Connect THEN\n    // Code to initiate connection to the broker\n    // Set Connected to TRUE if successful\n    // Set Error and ErrorCode if failed\nEND_IF\n\n// Logic for publishing a message\nIF Publish AND Connected THEN\n    // Code to publish the Payload to the specified Topic\n    // Set Error and ErrorCode if failed\nEND_IF\n\n// Logic for subscribing to a topic\nIF Subscribe AND Connected THEN\n    // Code to subscribe to the specified Topic\n    // Set Error and ErrorCode if failed\nEND_IF\n\n// Logic for receiving messages\n// This would typically involve checking a buffer or callback for new messages\nIF Connected THEN\n    // Code to check for new messages\n    // Set MessageReceived and ReceivedPayload if a new message is received\nEND_IF\n\n// Error handling\nIF Error THEN\n    // Code to handle errors, possibly resetting states or logging\nEND_IF\n\nEND_FUNCTION_BLOCK\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Inputs**: These are parameters that the function block will use to perform its operations, such as connecting to an MQTT broker, publishing, or subscribing to topics.\n- **Outputs**: These provide feedback on the operations, such as connection status, received messages, and error handling.\n- **Internal Variables**: Used to manage the state and logic within the function block.\n- **Logic**: This is where you would implement the actual MQTT operations, using appropriate libraries or APIs available in your environment.\n\nThis is a basic template and would need to be filled in with actual logic and possibly library calls specific to the environment you're working in."]]

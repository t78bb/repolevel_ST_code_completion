[["The provided code snippet defines a **FUNCTION_BLOCK** named `FB_PT1Filter` in Structured Text (ST), which is commonly used in PLC programming environments such as IEC 61131-3. This function block appears to implement a **PT1 filter**, which is a first-order low-pass filter often used for signal smoothing or filtering in control systems.\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n#### **Inputs (`VAR_INPUT`)**\n1. **`rInput`**:  \n   - Type: `REAL`  \n   - Default Value: `0.0`  \n   - Description: This is the input signal to the filter. It represents the raw data that needs to be filtered.\n\n2. **`rK`**:  \n   - Type: `REAL`  \n   - Default Value: `1.0`  \n   - Description: This is the gain factor of the filter. It scales the input signal before applying the filter.\n\n3. **`tT`**:  \n   - Type: `TIME`  \n   - Description: This represents the time constant of the filter. It determines the responsiveness of the filter (how quickly it reacts to changes in the input signal). A larger time constant results in slower response and more smoothing.\n\n#### **Outputs (`VAR_OUTPUT`)**\n1. **`rOutput`**:  \n   - Type: `REAL`  \n   - Default Value: `0.0`  \n   - Description: This is the filtered output signal. It is the result of applying the PT1 filter to the input signal.\n\n---\n\n### PT1 Filter Functionality:\nA PT1 filter is mathematically described as:\n\n\\[\nrOutput(t) = rK \\cdot rInput(t) + \\frac{1}{tT} \\cdot \\int_{0}^{t} (rInput(t) - rOutput(t)) \\, dt\n\\]\n\nIn discrete systems (like PLCs), this is typically implemented using a difference equation:\n\n\\[\nrOutput_{n} = rOutput_{n-1} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{tT} \\cdot (rInput_{n} - rOutput_{n-1})\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( rOutput_{n} \\): Current output value.\n- \\( rOutput_{n-1} \\): Previous output value.\n- \\( rInput_{n} \\): Current input value.\n- \\( \\Delta t \\): Sampling time (time between updates).\n- \\( tT \\): Time constant.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Notes:\n1. **Initialization**: Ensure that the filter is initialized properly, especially the `rOutput` value.\n2. **Sampling Time**: The filter's behavior depends on the sampling time (`\u0394t`). This is typically derived from the PLC cycle time.\n3. **Time Constant (`tT`)**: The `tT` parameter must be chosen carefully based on the desired filtering effect. A smaller `tT` results in faster response, while a larger `tT` results in slower response and more smoothing.\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage:\nTo use this function block in a PLC program:\n```pascal\nVAR\n    fbFilter: FB_PT1Filter;   // Instance of the PT1 filter\n    rInputSignal: REAL;       // Input signal\n    rFilteredSignal: REAL;    // Filtered output signal\nEND_VAR\n\nfbFilter.rInput := rInputSignal;  // Assign input signal\nfbFilter.rK := 1.0;              // Set gain\nfbFilter.tT := T#100ms;          // Set time constant to 100 milliseconds\n\nfbFilter();                      // Execute the filter\n\nrFilteredSignal := fbFilter.rOutput;  // Get the filtered output\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the `FB_PT1Filter` to filter an input signal and obtain a smoothed output signal."]]

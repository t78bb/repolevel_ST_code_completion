[["The `FB_DualAxisPower` function block is designed to manage the power-on sequence for two axes in a motion control system. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:\n\n### Input Variables\n- **Axis1: AXIS_REF**: A reference to the first axis. This typically includes all the necessary information and methods to control and monitor the axis.\n- **Axis2: AXIS_REF**: A reference to the second axis, similar to Axis1.\n- **bPowerOn: BOOL**: A boolean input that serves as the power enable signal. When `TRUE`, it indicates that the system should attempt to power on the axes.\n\n### Output Variables\n- **bPowerDone: BOOL**: A boolean output that indicates whether both axes are powered on and ready. It is `TRUE` when both `bAxis1Ready` and `bAxis2Ready` are `TRUE`.\n- **bAxis1Ready: BOOL**: A boolean output that indicates whether Axis1 is powered on and ready.\n- **bAxis2Ready: BOOL**: A boolean output that indicates whether Axis2 is powered on and ready.\n- **bError: BOOL**: A boolean output that signals an error condition. It is `TRUE` if there is an error in powering on either of the axes.\n\n### Functionality\nThe function block likely operates as follows:\n1. **Power-On Sequence**: When `bPowerOn` is `TRUE`, the function block attempts to power on both Axis1 and Axis2.\n2. **Readiness Check**: It monitors the status of each axis to determine if they are ready. This might involve checking status flags or feedback signals from the axes.\n3. **Error Handling**: If there is an issue in powering on either axis, `bError` is set to `TRUE`.\n4. **Completion**: Once both axes are ready, `bPowerDone` is set to `TRUE`.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- **Axis Control**: The actual implementation would require interaction with the specific methods and properties of the `AXIS_REF` type to control and monitor the axes.\n- **Error Conditions**: The function block should define what constitutes an error (e.g., timeout, fault signals) and handle it appropriately.\n- **Safety**: Ensure that the power-on sequence adheres to safety protocols to prevent damage to the system or harm to operators.\n\nThis function block is typically used in industrial automation systems where precise control of multiple axes is required, such as in CNC machines, robotic arms, or other automated machinery."], ["The `FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_DualAxisReset` is a structured text (ST) code block typically used in PLC programming for controlling two axes in a motion control system. Here's a breakdown of its components:\n\n### VAR_INPUT\n- **Axis1: AXIS_REF;**\n  - This is a reference to the first axis that needs to be reset. `AXIS_REF` is likely a predefined data type or structure that contains information about the axis, such as its current position, status, and configuration.\n\n- **Axis2: AXIS_REF;**\n  - Similar to `Axis1`, this is a reference to the second axis that needs to be reset.\n\n- **bExecute: BOOL;**\n  - This is a boolean input signal that triggers the reset operation. When `bExecute` is set to `TRUE`, the reset process for both axes should begin.\n\n### VAR_OUTPUT\n- **bDone: BOOL;**\n  - This boolean output indicates that the reset operation has been completed successfully. When `bDone` is `TRUE`, it means both axes have been reset.\n\n- **bBusy: BOOL;**\n  - This boolean output indicates that the reset operation is currently in progress. When `bBusy` is `TRUE`, it means the function block is actively working on resetting the axes.\n\n- **bError: BOOL;**\n  - This boolean output serves as an error flag. When `bError` is `TRUE`, it indicates that an error has occurred during the reset process.\n\n### Usage\nIn a typical application, you would use this function block to reset two axes in a coordinated manner. The process might involve the following steps:\n1. Set `bExecute` to `TRUE` to start the reset process.\n2. Monitor `bBusy` to determine when the reset is in progress.\n3. Check `bDone` to confirm successful completion of the reset.\n4. If `bError` is `TRUE`, handle the error according to your system's requirements.\n\nThis function block is useful in applications where synchronized control of multiple axes is required, such as in robotics, CNC machines, or automated manufacturing systems."], ["The `F_AxisStatusToString` function appears to be designed to convert the status of an axis (likely from a motion control system) into a string representation. Based on the provided code snippet, the function takes one input parameter, `fbReadStatus`, which is presumably an instance of the `MC_ReadStatus` function block. This function block is commonly used in motion control libraries to read the status of an axis.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the components:\n\n### Function Declaration\n```pascal\nFUNCTION F_AxisStatusToString : STRING\n```\n- **FUNCTION**: Indicates that this is a function, which will return a value.\n- **F_AxisStatusToString**: The name of the function.\n- **: STRING**: Specifies that the return type of the function is a `STRING`.\n\n### Input Variable\n```pascal\nVAR_INPUT\n    fbReadStatus : MC_ReadStatus; // Axis status reading function block\nEND_VAR\n```\n- **VAR_INPUT**: Declares input variables for the function.\n- **fbReadStatus**: The input variable, which is an instance of the `MC_ReadStatus` function block. This function block is likely used to retrieve the current status of an axis in a motion control system.\n\n### Expected Functionality\nThe purpose of the function is likely to:\n1. Retrieve the status of an axis using the `fbReadStatus` function block.\n2. Convert the status information into a human-readable string format.\n3. Return the string representation of the axis status.\n\n### Example Implementation\nWhile the actual implementation is not provided, here\u2019s an example of how this function might be implemented in a structured text (ST) programming language:\n\n```pascal\nFUNCTION F_AxisStatusToString : STRING\nVAR_INPUT\n    fbReadStatus : MC_ReadStatus; // Axis status reading function block\nEND_VAR\n\nVAR\n    axisStatus : STRING;\nEND_VAR\n\naxisStatus := ''; // Initialize the status string\n\nIF fbReadStatus.Error THEN\n    axisStatus := 'Error: ' + fbReadStatus.ErrorID; // Include error details\nELSIF fbReadStatus.Busy THEN\n    axisStatus := 'Busy'; // Axis is currently busy\nELSIF fbReadStatus.Done THEN\n    axisStatus := 'Done'; // Operation completed successfully\nELSE\n    axisStatus := 'Unknown Status'; // Default case\nEND_IF;\n\nRETURN axisStatus;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Example\n1. The function checks the status flags (`Error`, `Busy`, `Done`, etc.) of the `fbReadStatus` function block.\n2. Based on the flags, it assigns a corresponding string to the `axisStatus` variable.\n3. Finally, it returns the `axisStatus` string.\n\n### Notes\n- The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific motion control library and the available properties of the `MC_ReadStatus` function block.\n- Additional status flags or details might be included in the `MC_ReadStatus` function block, which can be incorporated into the string representation.\n\nIf you have more details about the `MC_ReadStatus` function block or the motion control system, I can refine the explanation further."], ["The code snippet you've provided appears to be part of a **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** program written in **Structured Text (ST)**, which is commonly used in industrial automation. The `FUNCTION_BLOCK ResetAxis` defines a function block named `ResetAxis` with an input variable `bExec`.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the code:\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **FUNCTION_BLOCK ResetAxis**:\n   - This defines a function block named `ResetAxis`. Function blocks are reusable components that encapsulate logic and can be instantiated multiple times in a PLC program.\n\n2. **VAR_INPUT**:\n   - This section declares input variables for the function block. Input variables are used to pass data into the function block.\n\n3. **bExec**:\n   - `bExec` is a Boolean input variable (`BOOL`) that likely serves as a trigger or execution signal for the function block. When `bExec` is `TRUE`, the function block may perform its intended operation (e.g., resetting an axis in a motion control system).\n\n4. **END_VAR**:\n   - This marks the end of the variable declaration section.\n\n### Possible Usage:\nThe `ResetAxis` function block might be used in a motion control system to reset the position or state of an axis (e.g., a motor or actuator). The `bExec` input could be connected to a condition or signal that initiates the reset process.\n\n### Example of How It Might Be Used:\n```structuredtext\nVAR\n    fbResetAxis : ResetAxis; // Instance of the ResetAxis function block\n    bResetTrigger : BOOL;   // Trigger signal\nEND_VAR\n\n// Logic to execute the ResetAxis function block\nfbResetAxis(bExec := bResetTrigger);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `fbResetAxis` is an instance of the `ResetAxis` function block.\n- `bResetTrigger` is a Boolean variable that triggers the reset operation when set to `TRUE`.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or additional details!"]]

  "description": "This function block implements a CANopen Safety Slave SIL2 I/O driver which is realized through a black channel approach. It sits on top of an unsafe CANopen Slave Stack. Communication between both stacks is realized over shared memory. The function block can be enabled/disabled by S_xEnable. When S_xEnable gets TRUE the function block checks all conditions for safe communication each bus cycle: Unsafe stack is in OPERATIONAL state, Configuration valid object (16#13FE) is set to 16#A5, Safety configuration signatures are correct, Consistency of SRDO configuration data. If a configuration error is detected (e.g. CRC mismatch) S_eError changes from NO_ERROR to the corresponding error code. If every condition is fulfilled the function block tries starting safe communication. Output S_xActive gets TRUE if all SRDOs are sent/received at least one time without any error. When communication error occurs (e.g. SCT/SRVT timeout, data mismatch, …), all SRDO communication is stopped: S_xActive FALSE S_eError NO_ERROR. Errors can be acknowledged by a rising edge of S_xErrorAck. Safe communication will be continued. Note: Do not instantiate this function block. It will be instantiated implicitly.",

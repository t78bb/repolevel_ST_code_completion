  "description": "This function block implements the logic of a CANopen Safety Remote Device. All instances are managed by the CANopenManagerSIL2 in a simple chained list and called on StartBusCycle. The function block gets its SRDO config in SetupSDROs and has its own pointer to the Safety Exchange. Function block can be enabled/disabled by S_xEnable. When S_xEnable gets TRUE the function block checks every bus cycle all conditions for safe communication: Unsafe stack is in OPERATIONAL state, CRCs read back from device are correct, Consistency of SRDO configuration data. If a configuration error is detected (e.g. CRC mismatch) S_eError changes from NO_ERROR to a corresponding error code. If every condition is fulfilled the function block tries starting safe communication. S_xActive gets TRUE if all SRDOs are sent/received at least one time without any error. When communication error occurs (SCT/SRVT timeout, data mismatch, …), all SRDO communication is stopped: S_xActive = FALSE, S_eError <> NO_ERROR. Errors can be acknowledged by a rising edge of S_xErrorAck. Safe communication will be continued.",

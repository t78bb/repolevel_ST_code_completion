[["It seems like you're working with a structured text (ST) code fragment for a PLC program. Here's a continuation of your code based on the context provided:\n\n```structured-text\nMETHOD CheckTankStatus : BOOL\nVAR_INPUT\n    nCurrentLevel : INT;\n    nCurrentTemp  : INT;\nEND_VAR\nVAR\n    bLevelInRange : BOOL;\n    bTempInRange  : BOOL;\nEND_VAR\n\n// Check if the current level is within the defined range\nbLevelInRange := (nCurrentLevel >= nMinLevel) AND (nCurrentLevel <= nMaxLevel);\n\n// Check if the current temperature is within the defined range\nbTempInRange := (nCurrentTemp >= nMinTemp) AND (nCurrentTemp <= nMaxTemp);\n\n// Return TRUE if both level and temperature are within range, otherwise FALSE\nCheckTankStatus := bLevelInRange AND bTempInRange;\n```\n\nThis method `CheckTankStatus` can be used to verify whether the current level and temperature of the tank are within the specified ranges. You can call this method and pass the current level and temperature as inputs to determine the tank's status.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have additional requirements, feel free to ask!"]]

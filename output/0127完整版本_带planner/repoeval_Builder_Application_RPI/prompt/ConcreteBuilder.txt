This is the known requirement information for the function to be completed:
This code is intended to implement a concrete builder class for constructing a product object based on client-provided specifications and guidance from a director class.
This provides you with a plan of implementation steps for the function to be completed. Subsequent ST code must strictly follow this plan and must not deviate from the core logic. The following is the plan of implementation steps:
功能规划:
1. 初始化产品对象的所有内部属性，确保可以接收后续构建操作的数据。
2. 收集客户端输入的规格参数，并验证符合构建约束条件。
3. 根据 director 提供的指导逻辑，将客户端输入参数和预定义规则结合，更新产品对象的属性。
4. 完成产品对象的构建步骤，将产品对象标记为“已完成”状态。
5. 返回构建完成的产品对象，供后续使用或验证。

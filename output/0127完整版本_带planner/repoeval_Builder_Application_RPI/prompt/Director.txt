This is the known requirement information for the function to be completed:
This code is intended to implement a Director class that delegates the construction of a final product object to a specified ConcreteBuilder.
This provides you with a plan of implementation steps for the function to be completed. Subsequent ST code must strictly follow this plan and must not deviate from the core logic. The following is the plan of implementation steps:
功能规划:  
1. 检查 `inputConcreteBuilder` 是否已初始化，并确保其有效性。  
2. 调用 `inputConcreteBuilder` 的建造方法以创建产品对象。  
3. 检索由 `inputConcreteBuilder` 创建的产品对象。  
4. 返回或保存生成的产品对象供后续使用。
Continue writing the following code:

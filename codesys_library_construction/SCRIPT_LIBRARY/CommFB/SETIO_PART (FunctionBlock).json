If the Output data are stored successfully and the Field Device is still cyclically communicating, the ENO output is set to 1.\nIf the Output data are stored successfully and the Field Device is still cyclically communicating, the ENO output is set to 1\nNever use GETIO-/SETIO_PART FBs concurrently with %I/%Q-Input/Output-Mapping for the same slot/subslot !\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK CANRemoteDeviceSafe\nThis function block implements the logic of a CANopen Safety Remote Device. All instances are managed by the CANopenManagerSIL2 in a simple chained list\nand called on StartBusCycle.\nThe function block gets its SRDO config in SetupSDROs and has its own pointer to the Safety Exchange.\nFunction block can be enabled/disabled by S_xEnable. When S_xEnable gets TRUE the function block checks every bus cycle\nall conditions for safe communication:\nUnsafe stack is in OPERATIONAL state\nCRCs read back from device are correct\nConsistency of SRDO configuration data\nIf a configuration error is detected (e.g. CRC mismatch) S_eError changes from NO_ERROR to a corresponding error code.\nIf every condition is fulfilled the function block tries starting safe communication.\nS_xActive gets TRUE if all SRDOs are sent/received at least one time without any error.\nWhen communication error occurs (SCT/SRVT timeout, data mismatch, â¦), all SRDO communication is stopped: S_xActive = FALSE, S_eError <> NO_ERROR\nErrors can be acknowledged by a rising edge of S_xErrorAck. Safe communication will be continued.\n",

  "text": "\nINTERFACE IRMPFBCommunication EXTENDS __SYSTEM.IQueryInterface\nImplement this interface for a custom FB in the POU-Pool (or a library in the POU Pool), so be available\nas FB used for the RMP-Communication accross the network. For each App1-App2 connection a pair of two\nFBs (one in App1 and one in App2) is instantiated.\nFBs implementing this interface have to transmit and receive given data via some kind of network connection\nconnection two applications of modules running on the latter. The following functions a comprised by this interface:\nIRMPFBCommunication.InitializeCommunicationParameters\nis called before the Cyclic-RMP-Communication and provides you with\nthe communication addresses of the application to receive messages from and to send messages to; this methods functionallity\nis mandatory\nIRMPFBCommunication.InitializeReceiveBuffers\nprovides you with pointers to the buffers holding the RMP data and mirrored\nvariables to be received; this methods functionallity is mandatory\nIRMPFBCommunication.InitializeSendBuffers\nprovides you with pointers to the buffers holding the RMP data and mirrored\nvariables to be sent; this methods functionallity is mandatory\nIRMPFBCommunication.CyclicCall\nis called cyclically after the initialization functions have been called; use this method to\nimplement all the communcational need for ina network connection, receiving via this connection and sending\nsending via this connection in respect to the given communication addresses. Directly read/write from/to the given\nbuffers; this methods functionallity is mandatory\nThe property\nIRMPFBCommunication.ReceiveCounter\nreturns the count of received full data sets; as long as no data was received, this\nproperty shall return 0; this methods functionallity is mandatory for a working RMP communication using custom FBs\nThe property\nIRMPFBCommunication.SendCounter\nreturns the count of sent full data sets\nand sent via any network; this methods functionallity is mandatory for a working RMP communication using custom FBs\nProperties:\nReceiveComAdress\nReceiveCounter\nSendCounter\nSendToComAdress\nMethods:\nCyclicCall\nInitializeCommunicationFBConnections\nInitializeCommunicationParameters\nInitializeReceiveBuffers\nInitializeSendBuffers\nStructure:\nCyclicCall (Method)\nInitializeCommunicationFBConnections (Method)\nInitializeCommunicationParameters (Method)\nInitializeReceiveBuffers (Method)\nInitializeSendBuffers (Method)\nReceiveComAdress (Property)\nReceiveCounter (Property)\nSendCounter (Property)\nSendToComAdress (Property)",

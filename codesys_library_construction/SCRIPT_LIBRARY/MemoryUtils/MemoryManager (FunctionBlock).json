If the last message was taken from the exchange, it automatically extends the exchange by the actual size. This can be disabled by setting AutoExtend = FALSE.\nHow to use:\nCall Create() with the block size and the number of blocks you would like to pre-allocate.\nCall Malloc() whenever you need memory. As long as MessagesLeft > 0 OR AutoExtend = FALSE, no SysMemAlloc will be performed!\nCall Free() to free memory allocated at the MemoryManager.\nCall Delete() before shutting down the system.\nProperties:\nActSize\nAutoExtend\nExchange\nInitSize\nMessagesLeft\nMethods:\nCreate\nDelete\nFB_Exit\nFree\nMalloc\nStructure:\nPrivate\nFB_Exit (Method)\nPublic\nActSize (Property)\nAutoExtend (Property)\nCreate (Method)\nDelete (Method)\nExchange (Property)\nFree (Method)\nInitSize (Property)\nMalloc (Method)\nMessagesLeft (Property)\ntop\nCODESYS Group | We\nsoftware\nAutomation.\nto software\n['sɒftwɛər]\ntransitive verb\n__softwared/softwaring\n: to develop software\n// to software automation: to develop software for automation purposes\nThe CODESYS Group is the manufacturer of CODESYS, the leading hardware-independent\n                                    IEC 61131-3 automation software for developing and engineering controller\n                                    applications.\nCODESYS® is a registered trademark.\nCODESYS GmbH\nA member of the CODESYS Group\nMemminger Straße 151, 87439 Kempten\nGermany\nTel.:\n+49-831-54031-0\ninfo@codesys.com\nLegal Notice\nPrivacy Policy\nLinkedIn\nYoutube\nRSS\nDownloads\nLogin\nCODESYS Store\n© 2022 CODESYS GmbH\n| A member of the CODESYS Group",

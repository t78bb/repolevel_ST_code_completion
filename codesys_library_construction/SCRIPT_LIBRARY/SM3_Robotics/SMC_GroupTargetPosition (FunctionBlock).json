  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_GroupTargetPosition\nThis function block returns the commanded target position\nof an axis group in the selected coordinate system.\nThere are several reasons why the output\nValid\nmay be\nFALSE\n:\nThe last commanded movement is relative and its start-position\nis not known yet (e.g. because there is a tracking-movement before).\nThe last commanded movement is a halt / stop and has not been\nprocessed yet.\nThe last commanded movement is not processed yet,\nCoordSystem\n=\nACS\nand the movementâs coordinate system\nis different from\nACS\n.\nBy âprocessingâ we mean an internal method that is called\nfor at most one movement per cycle, and only if its\nstart-position is known.\nValid\nand not\nStable\nmeans that the target position moves in the\nselected coordinate system.\nThis is an administrative FB, since no movement is generated.\n",

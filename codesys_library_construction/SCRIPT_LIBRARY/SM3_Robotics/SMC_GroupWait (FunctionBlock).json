  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL SMC_GroupWait\nProgrammed waiting on the path.\nSMC_GroupWait\nbehaves like a buffered movement command, leading\nto a wait for a given time between two movements.\nIt is not possible to blend into or from waiting.\nThe waiting time starts right after the previously commanded\nmovement has finished.\nThe waiting time between the two surrounding movements will be\nexactly the configured time.\nIf a waiting command follows a tracking movement, the axis group will\ntrack the endpoint of the preceding movement for the specified time.\nIf the axes are not in standstill, but not controlled by the axis group,\nand waiting is commanded, the axis group will report the error\nSMC_AXIS_GROUP_IDLE_WAIT_AXES_MOVING\n.\nAs set-values are updated once per bus cycle, waiting times different from\na multiple of the bus cycle time will just appear as a smoother start-up\nof the subsequent movement.\nNote\nBuffered movements always start at the beginning of a task cycle.\nThis means that there is an implicit wait of at most one task cycle\nbetween any two consecutive buffered movements.  The duration of this\nimplicit wait can be reduced by\nSMC_GroupWait\nwith a shorter wait\ntime.\n",

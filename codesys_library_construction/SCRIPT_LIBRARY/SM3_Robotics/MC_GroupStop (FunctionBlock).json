  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL MC_GroupStop\nThis function block commands a controlled motion stop and\ntransfers the axis group to the state\nGroupStopping\n.\nIt aborts any other motion command.\nWhile the axis group is in state GroupStopping, no other FB can\nperform any motion on the same axis group. After the axis group\nhas reached standstill, the\nDone\noutput is set to\nTRUE\nimmediately.\nThe axis group remains in the state\nGroupStopping\nas long as\nExecute\nis still\nTRUE\nor the axes are not yet in standstill.\nAs soon as\nDone\nis set and\nExecute\nis\nFALSE\n, the axis group\ngoes to  state\nGroupStandBy\n. The command can only be aborted by\nMC_Power\n.\nNote\nThe effective limits for deceleration and jerk are determined by the\ninputs\nDeceleration\n,\nJerk\n,\nAccFactor\n, and\nJerkFactor\n.\nThese limits can be exceeded in order to stay on the commanded path.\nNote\nIn contrast to\nMC_GroupHalt\nthe given dynamic limits are neither\ninfluenced by an override set using\nMC_GroupSetOverride\n, nor by\naxis limit factors set using\nSMC_GroupSetAxisLimitFactors\n, nor by\nancillary limits set using\nSMC_GroupSetAncillaryPathLimits\nand\nSMC_GroupSetAncillaryAxisLimits\nrespectively.\nFor halting point-to-point movements:\nthe velocity/acc-/deceleration/jerk of each axis are properties\nof each axis and not specified within this function block.\nSee also inputs\nAccFactor\nand\nJerkFactor\n.\nSMC_GroupSaveContinueData\nand\nMC_GroupContinue\ncan be used to\ncontinue on the original path after a stop, if\nClearMovements\nis\nset to FALSE.\nThe first movement after an\nMC_GroupStop\noverwrites the state of the\naxis group, so\nSMC_GroupSaveContinueData\nhas to be called before any\nnew movement is commanded.\nIf\nClearMovements\nis set to FALSE and there are any movements in a dynamic\ncoordinate system (see\nMC_TrackConveyorBelt\n,\nMC_TrackRotaryTable\n,\nMC_SetDynCoordTransform\n, or\nSMC_SetDynCoordTransformEx\n) that are not yet\nDone\nwhen\nMC_GroupStop\nis executed, the coordinate systems will remain\nInUse\neven after\nMC_GroupStop\nis\nDone\n.\n",

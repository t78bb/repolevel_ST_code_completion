  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_GroupJog2\nActivates coordinated jogging of the axis group.\nThis is the recommended function block to jog an axis group.\nIt replaces\nSMC_GroupJog\n.\nJogging is performed in the coordinate system defined by input\nCoordSystem\n.  To jog in machine coordinates, for example, use MCS here.\nSetting ABC_as_ACS allows to use a mixed interpretation of the\nreference axes, X/Y/Z as cartesian position and A/B/C as axis positions\nof the tool kinematics.\nJogging can be triggered by one or more rising edges in the\nForward\nand\nBackward\ninputs.\nThe function block will move all axes i whose inputs\n(Forward[i] XOR Backward[i]) evaluate to TRUE.\nJogging can be stopped by one or more falling edges in the\nForward\nand\nBackward\ninputs.\nNote\nA rising edge that results in both Backward[i] and Forward[i] being TRUE\nis interpreted as a falling edge.\nIf both rising and falling edges are detected, the former prevail.\nWarning\nPlease make sure to set the inputs\nVelFactor\n,\nAccFactor\n, and\nJerkFactor\nto safe values.  These values are crucial when jogging\nin the ACS or when jogging the orientation.  In these cases, the movement\nof the axes may be limited only by the global axis limits muliplied by\nthese factors.  When setting the factors to 1 (corresponding to 100%),\na very fast movement may result, which is not desirable for jogging.\n(Of course, the ancillary limits, axis limits set by\nSMC_GroupSetAxisLimitFactors\n, and the override are also considered.)\n",

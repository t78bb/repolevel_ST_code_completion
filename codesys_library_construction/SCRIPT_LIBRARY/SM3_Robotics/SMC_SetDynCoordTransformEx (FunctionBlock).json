  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_SetDynCoordTransformEx\nThis FB sets a dynamic product coordinate system (PCS).\nA movement commanded in this dynamic PCS will automatically âtrackâ this\ncoordinate system.  Simple examples are PCS that are fixed to a conveyor belt\nor a rotary table.\nThis FB may be called with a new rising edge on Execute only after the\nconfigured dynamic coordinate system is no longer in use by any movement,\notherwise error SMC_AXIS_GROUP_PCS_STILL_IN_USE will be returned.\nSee output\nInUse\n.\nNote\nFor special cases of a dynamic PCS, the function blocks,\nMC_SetDynCoordTransform\n,\nMC_TrackConveyorBelt\nand\nMC_TrackRotaryTable\ncan be used.\nThis FB does not start a movement (administrative FB). The movement is\ninitiated by a command in the defined PCS.\nThe PCS is defined in world coordinates, i.e.\ndynPCS\nreturns the\ncurrent pose of the PCS relative to the WCS.\n",

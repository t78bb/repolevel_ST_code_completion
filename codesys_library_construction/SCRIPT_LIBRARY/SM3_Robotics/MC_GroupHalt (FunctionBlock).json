  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL MC_GroupHalt\nThis function block commands a controlled motion stop.\nIt aborts all other motion function blocks, except\nMC_GroupStop\n.\nThe\nAxisGroup\nis moved to the state\nGroupMoving\n, until\ntransferred to\nGroupStandby\n.\nNote\nThe effective limits for deceleration and jerk are determined by the\ninputs\nDeceleration\n,\nJerk\n,\nAccFactor\n, and\nJerkFactor\n.\nThese limits can be exceeded in order to stay on the commanded path.\nNote\nIn contrast to\nMC_GroupStop\nthe given dynamic limits are influenced\nby an override set using\nMC_GroupSetOverride\nand by ancillary limits\nset using\nSMC_GroupSetAncillaryPathLimits\nand\nSMC_GroupSetAncillaryAxisLimits\nrespectively.\nFor halting point-to-point movements:\nthe velocity/acc-/deceleration/jerk of each axis are properties\nof each axis and not specified within this function block.\nSee also inputs AccFactor, and JerkFactor.\nSMC_GroupSaveContinueData\nand\nMC_GroupContinue\ncan be used to\ncontinue on the original path after a halt, if\nClearMovements\nis\nset to FALSE.\nThe first movement after an\nMC_GroupHalt\noverwrites the state of the\naxis group, so\nSMC_GroupSaveContinueData\nhas to be called before any\nnew movement is commanded.\nIf\nClearMovements\nis set to FALSE and there are any movements in a dynamic\ncoordinate system (see\nMC_TrackConveyorBelt\n,\nMC_TrackRotaryTable\n,\nMC_SetDynCoordTransform\n, or\nSMC_SetDynCoordTransformEx\n) that are not yet\nDone\nwhen\nMC_GroupHalt\nis executed, the coordinate systems will remain\nInUse\neven after\nMC_GroupHalt\nis\nDone\n.\n",

The output\nValid\nis FALSE in this case.\nThe trajectory duration cannot be read while an\nMC_GroupInterrupt\nis active or the axis group stops due to\nSMC_GroupInterruptAt\n.\nThe output\nValid\nis FALSE in this case.\nThe trajectory duration cannot by read while an\nMC_GroupSetOverride\nwith\nVelFactor\n= 0 or\nPathVelFactor\n= 0 is active.\nThe output\nValid\nis FALSE in this case.\nWhen the axis group has reached standstill and will not immediately start\nmoving again (e.g. because an\nSMC_GroupWait\nis active, or there is no\nfollowup movement), the output\nValid\nis FALSE.\n",

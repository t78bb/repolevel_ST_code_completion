  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_GroupSaveContinueData\nThis function block is used to save the continue data.\nThe continue data holds all necessary information to continue the\nmovement later on.  This includes any buffered or blending movements\nthat have been commanded.\nThe function block might need multiple cycles of the bus task in order to\nsave the continue data. During saving (\nBusy\nis\nTRUE\n) the function block\nhas to be called in every cycle. Otherwise, an error will be reported.\nOnce\nDone\nis\nTRUE\n, the continue data can be used with\nMC_GroupContinue\n.\nThe function block will return an error if the axis group is in state\nDisabled\nor\nErrorStop\n.\nNote\nOnly one instance of this function block may be active for one axis\ngroup at the same time.\nThe continue position is the current position of the axis group in\nthe cycle with the rising edge of\nExecute\n.\nSee also\nSMC_GroupGetContinuePosition\n.\nThe function block will save the state of the axis group at the end\nof the cycle with a rising edge of\nExecute\n. This means that\nthat e.g. movements that are commanded in the same cycle but after\nthe call of this function block with\nExecute\n=\nTRUE\nwill be\npart of the continue data.\n",

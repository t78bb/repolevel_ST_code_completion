It\nwill remove the text of already processed lines.\nNote\nThe output of the function block does not exactly match\nthe G-code stored in the editor or in the text file.\nFor example, no blank lines or comments will be output and\nvariables will be replaced with their value.\nThe function block is called in the same task as\nSMC_NCInterpreter\n.\nThe number of\nSMC_GCODEVIEWER_DATA\nobjects in the buffer\npBuffer\nmust be at least as large as the sum of all buffer sizes of the\nSMC_NCInterpreter\nand the path-preprocessing function blocks.\n",

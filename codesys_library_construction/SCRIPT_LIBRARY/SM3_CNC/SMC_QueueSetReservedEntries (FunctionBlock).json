If the number of free entries\nin the queue reaches this threshold, SMC_OutQueue.bFull will return TRUE.\nThis function block is intended for use with\nSMC_Interpolator2Dir\n.\nIt can be used to set the number of elements that can be interpolated\nin reverse direction.\nNote\nSMC_QueueSetReservedEntries\nis intended to be used after the\nlast path processing function block that copies the queue.\nIt will not work as desired when used after\nSMC_CheckVelocities\nor\nSMC_CheckForLimits\n.\n(These function blocks donât copy the queue but modify it in-place.)\n",

Subsequent function blocks should\nin turn use\npoqDataOut\nof this FB.\nIn contrast to other pre-processing function blocks,\nSMC_CheckForLimits\nworks on the\nSMC_Outqueue\n-structure only,\nit doesnât need a buffer and does not change the path\n(whose data is still held by the buffer of the previous function block).\n",

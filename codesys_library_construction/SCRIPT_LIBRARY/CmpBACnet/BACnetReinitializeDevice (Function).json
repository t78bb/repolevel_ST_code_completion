  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetReinitializeDevice :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a reinitializeDevice request.\nSends a message to instruct a remote Device to reboot itself (cold start) or reset\nitself (warm start). This routine may be used to execute setup/restore procedures.\nThis routine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation, and\ntimeout for both request and in response. This routine can execute asynchronously,\ni.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so\nthat the applications can keep running. In this case the response information will\nbe received by the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If the application does not supply the BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine;\nthen the BACnetReinitializeDevice routine sends a request and waits for reply.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetReadRange :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a ReadRange request\nSends a request to read a specific range of data items representing a subset of data\navailable within a specified object property. This routine may be used with any list\nor array of lists property. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length,\nsegmentation, and timeout for both request and in response. This routine can execute\nasynchronously, i.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply\ncomes so that the applications can keep running. In this case the response information\nwill be received by the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous\nresponses. An optional BACNET_READ_RANGE_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the\nBACnet application, shall be used to process this information. If a number of\nasynchronous requests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the\ntransaction handles. If the application does not supply the BACNET_READ_RANGE_COMPLETE_CB\nroutine; then the BACnetReadRange routine sends a request and waits for reply.\nAsynchron call, which fills pResult with the call result in an asynchronus manner. As soon as pContentsStatus\nis\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS.BACNET_STATUS_OK\nthe data in pContents is valid.\n",

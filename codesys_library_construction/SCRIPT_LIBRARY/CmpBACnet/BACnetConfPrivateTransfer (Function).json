This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation, and\ntimeout for both request and response. This routine can execute asynchronously, so\nthis routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply is received so that the\napplications keeps running. In this case the response information will be received\nby the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses. An optional\nBACNET_PRIVATE_XFER_COMPLETE_CB routine, which has to be provided by the BACnet application,\nwill be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous requests are\nsent, the responses will be queued and identified by the transaction handles. If the\napplication does not supply the BACNET_PRIVATE_XFER_COMPLETE_CB routine, then the\nBACnetConfPrivateTransfer routine sends a request and waits for reply.\nreturn IEC_BACNET_STATUS\n",

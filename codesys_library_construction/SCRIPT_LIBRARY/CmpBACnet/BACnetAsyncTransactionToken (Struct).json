  "text": "\nTYPE BACnetAsyncTransactionToken : STRUCT\nA transaction token for BACnet âasynchronous callsâ.\nFor all âasynchronous callsâ there is a callback in CODESYS runtime component CmpBACnet, which getâs called\nasynchronously after the IEC-code has startet the âasynchronous callâ.\nThis had been chosen as the best solution to avoid the complexitity of handling those callbacks via âIEC-Eventsâ.\nThe callback in CODESYS runtime component CmpBACnet sets a request status, which can be checked by the IEC-code,\nthis mechanism is referenced as âcaller status pollingâ later on.\nBACnetAsyncTransactionToken is used to identify transactions of âasynchronous callsâ like\nBACnetReadProperty\n,\nand to allow\nBACnetCancelPendingConfirmedRequest\nif needed.\nBACnetAsyncTransactionToken transports a pointer to the request status, to allow âcaller status pollingâ.\nThe caller had to provide the memory pointed to by this pointer.\n",

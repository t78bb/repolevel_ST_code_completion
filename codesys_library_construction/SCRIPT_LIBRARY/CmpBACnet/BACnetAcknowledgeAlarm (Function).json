  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetAcknowledgeAlarm :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an AcknowledgeAlarm request.\nSends a message to the initiating device to acknowledge that the operator has seen and\nresponded to the event notification that required the acknowledgment. This routine may\nacknowledge either Confirmed Event Notification or Unconfirmed Event Notification\nrequests. This routine allows to control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation\nand timeout for both request and response. This routine can execute asynchronously,\ni.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so that the\napplication can keep running. In this case the response information will be received\nby the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses. An optional\nBACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet application,\nshall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous requests are\nsent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction handles. If the\napplication does not supply the BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, then the\nBACnetAcknowledgeAlarm routine sends a request and waits for reply.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetDeleteObject :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a DeleteObject request.\nSends a request to remote device to delete an existing object. This service cannot be\napplied to Device object. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length,\nsegmentation and timeout for both request and response. This routine can execute\nasynchronously, i.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply\ncomes so that the applications can keep running. In this case the response information\nwill be received by the thread that is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnetc\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If application does not supply the BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine;\nthen the BACnetDeleteObject routine sends a request and waits for reply.\n",

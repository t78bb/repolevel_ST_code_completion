  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetCreateObject :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a CreateObject request.\nSends a request to create a new instance of an object which may be as standard as\nvendor-specified object. This service may provide initialization of the properties\nof the newly created standard objects or the property values may be written later.\nThis routine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation and timeout\nfor both request and response. This routine can execute asynchronously, i.e. this\nroutine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so that the\napplications can keep running. In this case the response information will be received\nby the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses. An optional\nBACNET_CREATE_OBJECT_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet application,\nshall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous requests are\nsent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction handles. If the\napplication does not supply the BACNET_CREATE_OBJECT_COMPLETE_CB routine; then this\nroutine sends a request and waits for reply.\n",

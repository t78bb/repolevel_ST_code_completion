  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetReadPropertyMultiple :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an ReadPropertyMultiple request.\nSends a request to read the values of one or more specified properties of one or more\nobjects. This routine may read a single property of a single object, a list of\nproperties of a single object, or any number of properties of any number of objects\nwithin one device. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length,\nsegmentation, and timeout for both request and response. This routine can execute\nasynchronously, i.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply\ncomes so that the applications can keep running. In this case the response information\nwill be received by the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_READ_PROP_MUL_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If the application does not supply the BACNET_READ_PROP_MUL_COMPLETE_CB routine\nthen the BACnetReadPropertyMultiple routine sends a request and waits for the reply.\nAsynchron call, which fills readAccessResult with the call result in an asynchronus manner. As soon as pContentsStatus\nis\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS.BACNET_STATUS_OK\nthe data in pContents is valid.\n",

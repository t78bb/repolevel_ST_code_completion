  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetWriteProperty :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a WriteProperty request\nSends a request to write a value to a property of an object. This routine may\ncontrol APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation, and timeout for both request\nand in response. This routine can execute asynchronously, i.e. this routine will return\nto the caller before the BACnet reply comes so that the applications can keep running.\nIn this case the response information will be received by the thread which is responsible\nfor receiving asynchronous responses. An optional BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine,\nwhich is provided by the application, shall be used to process this information. If a\nnumber of asynchronous requests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified\nby the transaction handles. If the application does not supply the\nBACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine; then the routine sends a request and waits\nfor the reply.\nAsynchron call. As soon as pResultStatus is\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS.BACNET_STATUS_OK\nthe\ncall was successfully completed.\n",

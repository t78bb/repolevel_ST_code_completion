  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetWriteFile :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an AtomicWriteFile request.\nWrite an octet string into a specified position in a specified file. The file may be\naccessed as records or as a stream of octets. Choice is defined by the value of\nFile_Access_Method property of the File object. Since the present version of this API\ndoes not support default processing of this service, the destination has to include a\nhook procedure to process it. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length,\nsegmentation, and timeout for both request and in response. This routine can execute\nasynchronously, i.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply\ncomes so that the applications can keep running. In this case the response information\nwill be received by the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_WRITE_FILE_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction handles.\nIf the application does not supply the BACNET_WRITE_FILE_COMPLETE_CB routine; then the\nBACnetWriteFile routine sends a request and waits for reply.\nAsynchron call, which fills pResult with the call result in an asynchronus manner. As soon as pResultStatus\nis\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS.BACNET_STATUS_OK\nthe data in pResult is valid.\n",

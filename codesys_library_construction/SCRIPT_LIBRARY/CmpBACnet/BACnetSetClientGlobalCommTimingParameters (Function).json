During connection establishment the\nAPDU parameters are read from the remote BACnet devices and used. But in some cases\nit might be useful TO override those parameters.\nTo remove the global timing parameters and use the dynamically assigned ones again\nset nTimeout, nSegmentTimeout AND nRetryCount TO -1.\nTo disable the periodic alive check set nAliveCheckInterval to 0.\n",

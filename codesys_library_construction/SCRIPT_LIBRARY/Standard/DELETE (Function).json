The implementation cannot be changed for compatibility reasons.\nIf\nPos=0\nis used, the parameter\nLEN\nis internally reduced by one!\nIt is generally recommended to use values in the range specified by IEC 61131-3. The smallest value for\nPos\nis specified there as\n1\n.\n(* Example declaration *)\nVarSTRING1\n:\nSTRING\n;\n(* Example in ST , result is 'SUSI' *)\nVarSTRING1\n:=\nDELETE\n(\n'SUXYSI'\n,\n2\n,\n3\n);\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_TrackSetValues\nThis function block tracks a given signal.\nThe axis will try to follow the signal as closely as possible\nwhile repecting the given maximum velocity, acceleration, deceleration,\nand jerk.\nThe tracked signal is given in form of the position, velocity,\nacceleration, and jerk at the end of each bus task cycle.\nIn contrast to\nSMC_FollowPosition\n,\nSMC_FollowPositionVelocity\n,\nand\nSMC_FollowSetValues\n, the given set position, velocity,\nacceleration and jerk is not simply applied to the axis.  Instead,\nthe axis tries to reach the desired values in the shortest time.\nAt the same time, it will respect the input Velocity, Acceleration,\nDeceleration, and Jerk.\nDuring execution, the axis is in state\nsynchronized_motion\n.\nThe function block will keep ownership of the axis until it is\naborted by another movement.  The ownership is kept even if the\ntracked signal is stationary and the function block is in sync.\nThe position of the tracked signal (\nfSetPosition\n) may either\nbe linear or modulo, with the modulo period given in input\nSignalModuloPeriod\n.\nIndependently, the axis may either be finite or modulo.  The modulo\nperiod of the signal and the axis may be different.\nNote\nThis function block does not support forecasts that are set up by\nSMC_SetForecast\n.\nMC_SetPosition\nallows changing the coordinate system of an axis.  The\nfSetPosition\nfor this function block is expected to be provided in the coordinate system that was\nactive when this function block was started.\n",

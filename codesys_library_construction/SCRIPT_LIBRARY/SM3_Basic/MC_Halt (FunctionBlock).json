  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_Halt\nThis function block stops the referenced axis in a controlled manner. If actions of other function blocks are running at this time,\nthe actions are aborted. The axis enters the\ndiscrete_motion\nstate until the velocity 0 is reached.\nIf the\nDone\noutput of\nMC_Halt\nis set, the state of the axis changes to\nstandstill\n.\nAs long as\nMC_Halt\nis active, a new motion command can be issued that interrupts the execution of\nMC_Halt\n.\nUnlike\nMC_Stop\n,\nMC_Halt\ncan also be overwritten.\nNote\nOverwriting the execution of\nMC_Halt\nA driverless vehicle detects an obstacle and is stopped with\nMC_Halt\n.\nThe obstacle is removed before the vehicle comes to a\nstandstill\n. By issuing a new motion command,\nMC_Halt\nis aborted and the trip is resumed without having come to a\nstandstill\n.\n",

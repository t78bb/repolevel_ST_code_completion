This means it is guaranteed that\nthe last 2^32 switch event identifiers are all unique.IDs are assigned in ascending order of the switch events, i.e. it is\nguaranteed that a later switch event has a higher ID (except for\na possible 32-bit overflow).NoteAn aborting movement or an override can change the order\nin which switch events occur or even change whether a switch event\noccurs at all.  If this happens, the IDs assigned to the changed\nevents can change, too.This ID is intended for determining whether a given event of a\nparticular switch has already been processed by the caller of\nthe function block: If events are processed in order, the ID of\nthe last processed event can be used to decide whether a given\nevent has already been processed."

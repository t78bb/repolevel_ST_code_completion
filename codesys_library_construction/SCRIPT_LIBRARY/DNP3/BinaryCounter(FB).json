  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL BinaryCounter EXTENDS\nPointWithFlags\nDNP3 datapoint of type (Binary) Counter.\nAn instance of BinaryCounter does represent an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 20 âcountersâ,\nand optionally also a datapoint of DNP3 object group 21 âfrozen countersâ.\nThis function block ist called BinaryCounter, because the slang term âBinary Counterâ is used frequently in DNP3 realm.\nDNP3 object group 21 âfrozen countersâ behaviour\nÂ¶\nIn general the DNP3 âfreezeâ is an activity only relevant for the master,\nthe âfrozenâ value is not of any interest for the application.\nNevertheless DNP3 defines a âfreeze-and-clearâ operation.\nThe DNP3 standard states - begin of citation â¦\nFreeze operations take two formsâfreeze and freeze-and-clear. With a freeze-and-clear type operation, the\ncounter value is zeroed after its counts are copied to the frozen counter.\nâ¦ end of citation.\nThis functionality is optional, and can be disabled setting enableFreezeAndClear:=FALSE.\nIf enabled, there are two aspects to take care of.\nFirst: the counter value will be zeroed during a âfreeze-and-clearâ operation - be aware: the variable value will be modified.\nSecond: eventually the application need to know, that an âfreeze-and-clearâ operation happend and need to do someting useful.\nThe output freezeAndClearOccurred is set to TRUE for one application cycle, to signal the application to do its part.\n",

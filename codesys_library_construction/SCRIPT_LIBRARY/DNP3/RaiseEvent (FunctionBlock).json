  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL RaiseEvent\nRaise an event related to a change of value or eventually change of flags of the given datapoint.\nAn instance of RaiseEvent allows to represent an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object of groups\n2 âbinary input eventâ\n4 âdouble-bit input eventâ\n11 âbinary output eventâ\n22 âbinary counter eventâ\n23 âfrozen counter eventâ\n32 âanalog input eventâ\n33 âfrozen analog input eventâ\n42 âanalog output eventâ\n111 âoctet string eventâ\nThe DNP3 object group of the event to raise results from the DNP3 object group of the given point.\nFor example: an instance of BinaryInput does relate to DNP3 object group 1 âbinary inputsâ,\nand so using RaiseEvent for such an instance of BinaryInput does raise an DNP3 object group 2 âbinary input eventâ.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL AnalogInput EXTENDS\nPointWithFlags\nDNP3 datapoint of type Analog Input including its deadband.\nAn instance of AnalogInput does represent an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 30 âanalog inputsâ,\nand optionally also a datapoint of DNP3 object group 31 âfrozen analog inputsâ and\na datapoint of DNP3 object group 34 âanalog input reporting deadbandsâ.\nAnalogInput provides a lowLimit, highLimit and a deadband.\nDonât confuse this deadband with an instance of DNP3 object group 34 âanalog input reporting deadbandsâ.\nThe AnalogInput.deadBand is an private functionality of an AnalogInput instance.\nDNP3 master read/write access to this deadBand can be enabled with an optional instance of AnalogInputDeadband\nwhich relates to the same point number.\nDNP3 Analog Input provides the option to use certain data types to represent the value using\nAnyNumber\n.\nSINT (8bit -128 .. 127)\nUSINT (16bit 0 .. 255)\nINT (16bit -32768 .. 32767)\nUINT (16bit 0 .. 65535)\nDINT (32bit -2147483648 .. 2147483647)\nUDINT (32bit 0 .. 4294967295)\nREAL\nDOUBLE\nAny one of the types listed can be used for value, lowLimit, highLimit and deadBand,\nall variables have to be of same base type.\nPlease be aware:\nAnyNumber\nprovides a value representation as well as a POINTER TO value representation.\nDNP3 object group 31 âfrozen analog inputsâ behaviour\nÂ¶\nIn general the DNP3 âfreezeâ is an activity only relevant for the master,\nthe âfrozenâ value is not of any interest for the application.\nNevertheless DNP3 defines a âfreeze-and-clearâ operation.\nThe DNP3 standard states - begin of citation â¦\nWith a freeze-and-clear type operation the\nunderlying analog input value is preset to a suitable, possibly non-zero number after its value is copied to\nthe frozen analog variable. Two applications where freeze-and-clear would be useful are when the\nunderlying analog input holds either a peak value (minimum or maximum) or an integrated value that is\nreinitialized by the clear action from a freeze-and-clear request.\nâ¦ end of citation.\nThis functionality is optional, and can be disabled setting enableFreezeAndClear:=FALSE.\nIf enabled, there are two aspects to take care of.\nFirst: the underlying analog input value is preset to freezeAndClearValue during a âfreeze-and-clearâ operation - be aware: the variable value will be modified.\nSecond: eventually the application need to know, that an âfreeze-and-clearâ operation happend and need to do someting useful.\nThe output freezeAndClearOccurred is set to TRUE for one application cycle, to signal the application to do its part.\n",

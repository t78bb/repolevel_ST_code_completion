  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_GroupSetAncillaryAxisLimits\nThis function block configures so called ancillary dynamic axis limits\nfor an axis group, that is ancillary limits for the velocity, acceleration,\ndeceleration, and jerk of each axis.\nThe ancillary limits allow an easy programming of different operating modes\nof a robot, for example a manual mode in which the robot may only move\nslowly for safety reasons.\nInitially, all ancillary limits are infinite. The limits are not reset\nwhen the axis group is disabled or enabled.  If an axis is removed from\nthe group, the ancillary limits for this axis are reset.  If the\naxis is added again, later, then the ancillary limits are infinite.\nThe effective dynamic limits for a movement are built from the following\ninputs:\nG: the global axis limits stored in the axis configuration,\nM: the factors given at the movement function blocks (inputs VelFactor,\nAccFactor, â¦),\nF: the factors set with\nSMC_GroupSetAxisLimitFactors\n,\nO: the current override factors, and\nA: the ancillary axis limits.\nThe effective axis limits L are computed from these inputs as\nL = O * min(A, M * F * G).\nNote\nThis function block may not be called in the states\nGroupDisabled\nor\nGroupErrorStop\n, and, if\nExecutionMode\nequals\nImmediately\n, no\nMC_GroupStop\nmay be active.\nNo axis limit may be zero or negative.  Otherwise,\nthe function block returns an error.\nMC_GroupStop\nignores ancillary limits.\n",

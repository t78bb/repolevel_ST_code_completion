  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetReadProperty :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a ReadProperty request\nSends a request to read the value of a property of an object. This routine may send\nasynchronous messages, i.e. this routine will complete its execution before the BACnet\nreply comes so the applications can keep running. The response information will be\nreceived by an internal thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous\nresponses. An optional BACNET_READ_PROP_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by\nthe BACnet application, may be used to process this information. If a number of\nasynchronous requests are sent, the responses may be queued and identified by the\napplication provided handles. If this routine does not use the BACNET_READ_PROP_COMPLETE_CB\nroutine, then the\nBACnetReadProperty\nroutine sends a request and waits for the reply.\nThis routine may control APDU Properties like APDU length and segmentation and timeout,\nboth during its execution and in response processing.\nAsynchron call, which fills pContents with the call result in an asynchronus manner. As soon as pContentsStatus\nis\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS.BACNET_STATUS_OK\nthe data in pContents is valid.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetWritePropertyMultiple :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an WritePropertyMultiple request.\nModifies the values of one or more specified properties of one or more Objects.\nThis routine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation, and timeout\nfor both request and in response. This routine can execute asynchronously, i.e. this\nroutine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so that the\napplication can keep running. In this case the response information will be received\nby the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses. An optional\nBACNET_WRITE_PROP_MUL_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the application,\nshall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous requests are\nsent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction handles.\nIf the application does not supply the BACNET_WRITE_PROP_MUL_COMPLETE_CB routine\nthen this routine sends a request and waits for the reply.\nAsynchron call. As soon as pResultStatus is\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS.BACNET_STATUS_OK\nthe call was successfully completed.\n",

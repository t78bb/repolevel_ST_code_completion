  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_VelocityProfile\nThis function block follows a trajectory given by an array of\n(time, velocity) values.\nNote\nIf\nAxis\ndoes not reach standstill after this movement and no subsequent\nmovement is commanded in the same cycle when\nDone\nis set, then\nAxis\nswitches to the\nerrorstop\nstate and reports error\nSMC_MOVING_WITHOUT_ACTIVE_MOVEMENT\n.\nThe number of points of the profile is limited to 100.  If more is required,\nMC_CamIn\nwith a virtual master axis offers a much more flexible functionality,\nalso supporting periodic operation and ramping in.  See also the warnings below\nfor further restrictions of this function block.\nSee also\nMC_PositionProfile\nand\nMC_AccelerationProfile\n.\nWarning\nMC_MoveSuperimposed\nis not supported on top of\nMC_VelocityProfile\nMC_SetOverride\ndoes not influence\nMC_VelocityProfile\nForecasts that are set up by\nSMC_SetForecast\nare not supported.\n",

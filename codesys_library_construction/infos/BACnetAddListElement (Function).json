  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetAddListElement :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an Add-List-Element request.\nSends an Add-List-Element request to add one or more list elements to an object\nproperty which is a list. This routine sends Add-List-Element request using address\ninstead of device handle to identify destination device. This routine allows to\ncontrol APDU properties like APDU length and segmentation and timeout for both\nrequest and response. This routine can execute asynchronously, i.e. this routine\nwill return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so that the application can\nkeep running. In this case the response information will be received by the thread\nwhich is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses. An optional\nBACNET_CHANGE_LIST_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet application,\nshall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous service\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If the application does not supply BACNET_CHANGE_LIST_COMPLETE_CB, then the\nBACnetAddListElement routine sends a request and waits for the reply.\n",

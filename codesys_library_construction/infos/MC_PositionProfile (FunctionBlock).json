If more is required,\nMC_CamIn\nwith a virtual master axis offers a much more flexible functionality,\nalso supporting periodic operation and ramping in.  See also the warnings below\nfor further restrictions of this function block.\nExample\nTime/Position profile\nÂ¶\nSee also\nMC_VelocityProfile\nand\nMC_AccelerationProfile\n.\nWarning\nMC_MoveSuperimposed\nis not supported on top of\nMC_PositionProfile\n.\nMC_SetOverride\ndoes not influence\nMC_PositionProfile\nForecasts that are set up by\nSMC_SetForecast\nare not supported.\n",

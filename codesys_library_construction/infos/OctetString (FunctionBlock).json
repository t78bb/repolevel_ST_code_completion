  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL OctetString EXTENDS\nPoint\nDNP3 datapoint of type Octet String.\nAn instance of AnalogInput does represent an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 110 âoctet stringsâ.\nPlease be aware, that - as opposed to other DNP3 object group definitions - an instance of DNP3 object group 110 âoctet stringsâ\nallows for DNP3 master read / write access. Master write access can be disabled using enableWrite.\nIn contrast to all other DNP3 object groups which support command / write,\na datapoint DNP3 object group 110 âoctet stringsâ is meant to write to the same memory than to read from.\nThis may not be practical within a PLC application, most obviously because the write will happen from another task context (the low level DNP3 stack) without any synchronization\nwith your IEC application. So OctetString distinguishes between memory to read from and memory to write to.\nIn case master write access is enabled (enableWrite=TRUE),\npBufOut/pLengthOut is written by a master write operation, thus signaled by writeActive.\nAn active master write can be reset using resetWrite, thus setting pLengthOut^ to 0.\n",

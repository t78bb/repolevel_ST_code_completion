Since several FBs implementing IBACnetEventConsumer can be registered for one event or callback the\nfollowing rules are used for the returned BOOL:\nIf the method returns FALSE, all other registered IBACnetEventConsumer objects for the specified Hook/Callback are further called.\nIf the method return TRUE, the other registeres IBACnetEventConsumer objects are not called anymore. The calling order is as\nthe objects were registered. All calls have to treat on their own, whether the EventIds are correct (see CmpBACnet.EVENTIDS) and/or\nBACnet-Object-IDs or other additional data fits the needs of the registered FB (i.e. the specific BACnet-Object-FB).\n",

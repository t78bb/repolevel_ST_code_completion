          "Initial": "4",
          "Comment": "It works like modeQUADRATICbut creates a jerk profile without jumps.\nThis is done by replacing the linear ramps of the acceleration by\nmonotone functions that have zero slope at the start- and end-point.\nThe function must lead to the same end velocity and end position\nafter the acceleration ramp.\nThis is similar to the way a sinÂ² function is used instead of a\nlinear velocity ramp in the sigmoidal velocity mode.\nIn particular, the computation of the segments and the length and\nduration of the segments is not affected."

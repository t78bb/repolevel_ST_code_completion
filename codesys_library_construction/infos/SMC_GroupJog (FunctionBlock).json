  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_GroupJog\nThis function block has been deprecated.\nPlease donât use it in new projects. See\nSMC_GroupJog2\nfor the\nrecommended way to jog an axis group.\nWarning\nWith SoftMotion version 4.11.0.0, the support for input ABC_as_ACS has\nbeen dropped.  Please change to\nSMC_GroupJog2\nif this feature is\nrequired.\nActivates coordinated jogging of the axis group.\nWhen this function block is active, the axis group tracks\nthe position (and orientation) given by the axes connected to\nthe inputs AxisX, AxisY, AxisZ, AxisA, AxisB, and AxisC.\nInitially, a movement to the current position of the\naxes is commanded.  Once this movement is done, the output\nInitialPositionReached\nis TRUE.\nThe position of the axes is interpreted in the coordinate system\ndefined by input\nCoordSystem\n.  To jog in machine coordinates,\nfor example, use MCS here.\nSince the position is followed via tracking, one of the product\ncoordinate systems is used for this purpose.  This can be\nconfigured in input\nCoordSystemPCS\n.  Note that this coordinate\nsystem of the axis group is changed.\nTo perform cartesian jogging, the function blocks\nMC_Jog\nor\nSMC_Inch\ncan be used on the axes given as inputs to this\nfunction block.  It is recommended to call the movement function blocks\nof the virtual axes _before_ SMC_GroupJog.\nBefore restarting this FB without changing CoordSystemPCS,\nyou have to command an additional movement, like\nMC_GroupHalt\n.\nOtherwise, error SMC_AXIS_GROUP_PCS_STILL_IN_USE is returned.\nCompared to\nSMC_GroupJog2\n, this function block has several disadvantages:\nThe input ABC_as_ACS is no longer supported (since SoftMotion 4.11.0.0).\nIt requires virtual axes for all jogged coordinates.\nIf the robot cannot follow the configured jogging velocity,\njogging may leave the straight-line path, or move the TCP temporarily\neven if only the orientation is being jogged.\nA path override commanded with\nMC_GroupSetOverride\ndoes not affect\n(cartesian) jogging.\n",

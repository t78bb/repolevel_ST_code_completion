  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetDeviceCommControl :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a deviceCommunicationControl request.\nInstructs a remote device to enable/disable initiating and responding to all APDUs\n(except Device-Communication-Control and Reinitialize-Device, in the\nIEC_BACNET_DCC_VALUE.DCC_DISABLE\ncase). This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation and\ntimeout for both request and response. This routine can execute asynchronously,\ni.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so that\nthe applications can keep running. In this case the response information will be\nreceived by the thread that is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If the application does not supply the BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine;\nthen the BACnetDeviceCommControl routine sends a request and waits for reply.\n",

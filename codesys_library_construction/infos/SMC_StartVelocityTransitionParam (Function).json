A factor of 1 (100%) means that\nblending is started when the deceleration phase would begin\non the unmodified first movement, and finished when the\nacceleration phase would end on the unmodified second movement.\nLarger factors lead to a larger blending area, smaller factors\nlead to a smaller blending area."

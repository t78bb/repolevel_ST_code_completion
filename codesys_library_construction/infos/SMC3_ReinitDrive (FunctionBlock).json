  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC3_ReinitDrive\nThis function block reinitializes a drive/axis.\nThat means that the start-up phase is executed again.\nNote\nDo not call the function block until the axis has reached\ncommunication state\nSMC_COMSTATE_BASE_COM_INITIALIZATION\nor higher. See also:\nSMC_CheckAxisCommunication\n.\nThe input\nbVirtual\ndetermines whether the axis should be put into\nvirtual mode.  In virtual mode, an axis is replaced by a simulation,\njust like a virtual drive device.\nThis has no influence on the field bus devices, which will work as usual\nbut without receiving messages from or sending messages.\nThis input corresponds to the âVirtual modeâ check box in the SoftMotion\ndevice editor.\nFor drive devices, note that\nSMC3_ReinitDrive\ndoes not start the\nassociated field bus automatically.\n",

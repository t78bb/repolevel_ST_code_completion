  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_SmoothAddAxes\nThis function smoothes motions of additional axes distributed over several objects.\nThis leads to a constant slope of the additional axes P, Q, U, V, W and to\nthe usage of an optimized polynomial motion profile by the axes A, B and C.\nActivation of smoothing\nSmoothing must be enabled and disabled in G-Code using G71 and G70.\nG71 starts the smoothing, G70 ends the smoothing. The additional axes that should\nbe smoothed are defined by the parameter L<Additional axis number>.\nDefinition of the additional axis number:\nParameter\nAdditional Axis\nL4\nA\nL5\nB\nL6\nC\nL7\nP\nL8\nQ\nL9\nU\nL10\nV\nL11\nW\nExample G-Code\nN0 G1 X100 A0 Q100 F100\nN10 G71 L8    (Turn on smoothing for Q)\nN20 G1 X200\nN30 G71 L4    (Turn on smoothing for A)\nN40 G1 X250\nN50 G1 X300\nN60 G1 X350\nN70 G1 X400 A100\nN80 G70 L4    (Turn off smoothing for A)\nN90 G1 X500 Q0\nN100 G70 L8   (Turn off smoothing for Q)\nNote\nThe output data buffer available to the function block must be large\nenough to contain a complete smoothing range.\nIf the output data buffer has space for n objects, no more than n-3\ninput objects can be smoothed. Otherwise, smoothing is exited with error.\nPROBE movements such as G31 are not supported. The error\nSMC_PROBE_G31_NOT_ALLOWED\nis reported if a PROBE movement\nis encountered while additional axis smoothing is active.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_GroupUpdate\nThis function block can be used to bring forward\nthe execution of all of the axis groupâs implicit computations.\nIf\nEnable\n=\nTRUE\n, they will be shifted from the end of the cycle\nto the execution-time of this function block.\nNote\nAll function blocks that influence the state of the axis group should be called\nbefore this function block.\nE.g. if you want to move a single axis of the axis group via a single axis\nfunction block, the torque values are not updated by the axis group if you\ncall the single axis function block after SMC_GroupUpdate.\nNote\nAll function blocks that require the final state of the axis group for this\ncycle have to be called after SMC_GroupUpdate.\nE.g. if you use an axis of the axis group as a master axis for another axis,\nthe respective master/slave function block has to be called after SMC_GroupUpdate.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetSubscribeCOVProperty :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an SubscribeCovProperty request\nSends a message to subscribe a COV client to receive COV notifications for an arbitrary\nproperty in an arbitrary BACnet object, or to cancel an existing subscription. If the\nobject supports COV reporting, COV notifications may be sent to one or more subscriber\nclients. A subscription establishes a connection between the change of value detection\nand reporting mechanism within the COV initiating object, and a logical process within\nthe COV-client. This routine may control APDU Properties like APDU length and\nsegmentation and timeout for both request and response processing. This routine may\nsend asynchronous messages, i.e. this routine will complete its execution before the\nBACnet reply comes so the application can keep running. In this case the response\ninformation will be received by the thread which is responsible for receiving\nasynchronous responses. An optional BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is\nprovided by the BACnet application, shall be used to process this information. If a\nnumber of asynchronous messages are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified\nby the transaction handles. If no BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine is used then\nBACnetSubscribeCOVProperty routine sends a request message and waits for the reply.\nNOTE\n: If fLifeTimePresent and fCovIncrementPresent of pSubscriber are not set to 1, on some systems\nerrors may occur. However, these parameters can be 1 any time, because a liftime of 0\nindicates infinite lifetime and an increment of 0 an infinitesimal small increment.\n",

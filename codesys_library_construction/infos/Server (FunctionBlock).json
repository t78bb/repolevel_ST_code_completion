  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK ABSTRACT Server\nMODBUS server (slave) base class.\nSupported function codes\nÂ¶\nSupported function codes can be configured, see fcsSupported.\nBy default the MODBUS server supports:\nReadCoils\nReadDiscreteInputs\nReadHoldingRegisters\nReadInputRegisters\nWriteSingleCoil\nWriteSingleRegister\nWriteMultipleRegisters\nReadWriteMultipleRegisters\nOptionally it supports also:\nMaskWriteRegister\nâdata modelâ\nÂ¶\nThe âdata modelâ allows:\nnon-consecutive index for the âdata itemsâ (for example: index 0..9, 20..29)\nmultiple (non-consecutive) memory blocks for âdata itemsâ in one âdata blockâ (for example: index 0..9 => memory block 1, index 20..29 => memory block 2)\nnot-memory-mapped âdata itemsâ (user code needs to be written to handle reads/writes for those âdata itemsâ)\nâdiscrete inputsâ / âcoilsâ : data item size 1 bit or 8 bit (basically: ARRAY [0..numBits/8] OF BYTE vs. ARRAY [0..numBits-1] OF BOOL)\nâinput registersâ / âholding registersâ : data item size of 16 bit (basically: ARRAY [0..numRegisters-1] OF UDINT)\noverlapping memory blocks, could overlap âregistersâ with âregistersâ as well as âregistersâ with âdiscrete inputsâ / âcoilsâ (caution - hard to use feature)\nTo support all this the âdata modelâ (\nTableDefinitions\n) defines zero or more\nTableSection\nfor each of the MODBUS âprimary tablesâ (\nTableDefinition\n).\nSome more or less obvious limitations:\nall âdata itemsâ in one section need to have the same TableSection.uiDataItemSize\nall âdata itemâ index in one âprimary tableâ have to be unique, so no section index overlap is allowed of course\nread/write requests must not span more than one section\nâdata itemâ offset / âdata itemâ numbers\nÂ¶\nPlease note: unlike standard MODBUS, in CODESYS MODBUS the âdata itemâ numbers are equal to the âdata addressesâ.\nThe MODBUS standard states: âIn the MODBUS data Model each element within a data block is numbered from 1 to n.â\nIn CODESYS MODBUS the âdata itemsâ are numbered from 0 to n-1.\n",

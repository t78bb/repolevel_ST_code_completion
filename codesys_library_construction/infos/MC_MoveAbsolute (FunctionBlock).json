  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_MoveAbsolute\nThis function block causes the axis to be moved to an absolute position and uses the values for\nVelocity\n,\nDeceleration\n,\nAcceleration\nand\nJerk\n.\nIf no further actions are pending, the execution ends with velocity 0. (See:\nstandstill\n)\nExample\nUse of\nMC_MoveAbsolute\nThe following illustration shows two possibilities for combining two instances (\nFirst\nand\nSecond\n) of the type\nMC_MoveAbsolute\n.\nIn the left-hand part of the diagram the\nSecond\ninstance is called after the\nFirst\ninstance.\nIf\nFirst\nhas reached the specified position of 6000 and the input\nVelocity\nis 0, then the\nDone\noutput will cause the\nSecond\ninstance to move the axis to the position 10000.\nIn the right-hand part of the diagram, the execution is started by\nSecond\nwhile\nFirst\nis still operating.\nThe motion caused by\nFirst\nis interrupted and aborted by the\nTest\nsignal which is transmitted during the constant velocity phase of\nFirst\n.\nSecond\nsteers directly to position 10000, even though position 6000 has not yet been reached.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_MoveVelocity\nThis function block causes an endless motion at a specified velocity.\nExample\nUse of\nMC_MoveVelocity\nThe following illustration shows how two instances (\nFirst\nand\nSecond\n) of the function block\nMC_MoveVelocity\nare combined.\nIn the left-hand part of the illustration the\nSecond\ninstance is called after the\nFirst\ninstance. If\nFirst\nachieves the specified velocity 3000,\nthen the\nFirst\noutput\nInVelocity\nis ANDed with the\nNext\nsignal. This causes\nSecond\nto move at velocity 2000.\nIn the right-hand part of the illustration the execution is started by\nFirst\n, which aborts the previously executed\nSecond\ninstance and therefore the\n   output\nInVelocity\nof the\nSecond\ninstance  is set to False. Although\nFirst\nis still accelerating in order to reach velocity 3000, it is interrupted and\naborted because the\nTest\nsignal starts the execution of\nSecond\n. Now\nSecond\nwill decelerate the velocity to 2000 after which the\nInVelocity\nof\nthe\nSecond\ninstance is set to TRUE.\n",

This has the following\neffects:Depending on the performance of the PLC, higher values of this parameter\ncan slightly delay the start of a movement from standstill. However, for\nPLCs with good performance, this delay will be much smaller than the\nconfigured value of this parameter.On the other hand, some operations that are executed on an ongoing movement\nare affected by this parameter and result in a higher latency. The latency\nincreases by the value that is set for this parameter.\nIt affects the following operations: (1) Movements withMC_BUFFER_MODE.Aborting.\n(2) Changing the dynamics withMC_GroupSetOverride. (3) Performing an immediate\ninterrupt withMC_GroupInterrupt. (4) Applying ancillary limits withSMC_GroupSetAncillaryAxisLimitsorSMC_GroupSetAncillaryPathLimitsand\nexecution modeMC_EXECUTION_MODE.Immediately.

For a planning interval of 0.016 s and a sync buffer\nduration of 0.05 s, a typical forecast duration is 0.3 s.  In this case,\na forecast duration of more than 8 seconds (a value that is very high and\nnot recommended due to the resulting latency) leads to an error.\nThe recommended range for the quotient\n(sync buffer duration + forecast duration) / fPlanningInterval\nis between 0 and 25, the maximum is 511.\nThe current planning forecast can be monitored using theCurrentPlanningForecastoutput ofMC_GroupReadStatus."

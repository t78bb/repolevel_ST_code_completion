  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_GroupContinue\nThis function block transfers the axis group back to the situation stored\nin the\ncontinueData\n.\nIt immediately returns\nCommandAborted\nif\nMC_GroupStop\nis active.\nAn error is returned if the axis group is not in state GroupStandby.\nThe axis group must be at the continue-position, which is stored in\ncontinueData\n.  (See\nSMC_GroupGetContinuePosition\n.)\nIf a CP-tracking-movement is to be continued, the axis group needs\nto be following the PCS at this position, otherwise the axes must be\nin state\nstandstill\n.\n..note::\nThe continue data can be recorded using\nMC_GroupInterrupt\nor\nSMC_GroupInterruptAt\n, by calling\nSMC_GroupSaveContinueData\n,\nor automatically on an axis group error when enabled, see\nSMC_GroupEnableResumeAfterError\n.\n..note::\nWhen trying to continue from a position in a dynamic coordinate system,\nthe continue data has to be updated using\nSMC_GroupUpdateContinueData\n",

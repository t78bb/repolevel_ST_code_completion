  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_MoveContinuousAbsolute\nThis function block executes an absolute movement with a given end-velocity.\nIn contrast to\nMC_MoveAbsolute\n, it will not reach the target position with\nzero velocity, but with the specified\nEndVelocity\n.\nIt is designed for generating via movements. Once the target position has\nbeen reached, the function block sets the\nInEndVelocity\noutput and\nkeeps this velocity until interrupted by another movement.\nNote\nTake care when using\nMC_SetOverride\nwhile this function block is\nactive.\nIf\nAdaptEndVelToAvoidOvershoot\nis set to FALSE, reducing the\nacceleration or jerk override or changing the velocity override\ncan lead to a position overshoot or reversal.  This happens if\nthe (potentially overridden)\nEndVelocity\ncannot be reached from\nthe current state using the overridden\nAcceleration\n,\nDeceleration\n, and\nJerk\nlimits.\n",

To arrive at the target position with this\nvelocity, the axis will first exceed the position, reverse and\naccelerate to the end velocity, again causing an overshoot.If the inputAdaptEndVelToAvoidOvershootis TRUE, then the\neffective end velocity will be adapted in order to avoid an overshoot.These are the two situatons where an overshoot will be avoided:First, if the remaining distance is too short to reach the desired\nEndVelocity.  In this case, the effective end velocity is reduced\n(if the current velocity is lower) or increased (if the current\nvelocity is higher) to the closest velocity that can be reached\nin the given distance.Second, if the direction of the end velocity is opposite to the\ndirection of the movement.  In this case, the effective end velocity\nwill be set to zero.  Note that the direction of the movement is\nnot determined by the current velocity and acceleration, but by\nthe sign of the distacne to the target position.Note that the outputInEndVelocityis set only after the programmed\nend velocity has been reached.

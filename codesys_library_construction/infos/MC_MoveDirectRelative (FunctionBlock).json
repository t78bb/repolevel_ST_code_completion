  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL MC_MoveDirectRelative\nThis function block commands a movement of an axis group by the specified\nrelative distance in the specified coordinate system .\nEach axis is moved to its target position independently, the movement\nis only synchronized such that all axes reach the target at the same\ntime.  This means that the path travelled by the TCP depends on the\nkinematic transformation used.  In general, it will not be a line.\n(This is called a point to point or PTP movement.)\nNote\nThe path travelled by the TCP results indirectly from the movement\nof the axes and the kinematic transformation.  It is not easy to\npredict the path based on the start- and end-position of the movement.\nHowever, once a PTP movement has been taught-in, the path is not\nmodified by changing the override, interrupting, halting, or stopping.\nIn more detail:\nThe path is independent of the override.\nThe path is independent of the limits of the axes\n(limits for velocity, acceleration, deceleration, and jerk).\nThe only exception is for determining the cutoff points in\nTMStartVelocity mode.\nIn TMCornerDistance mode, the path is independent of the\nblending type (BlendingHigh/Low/Previous/Next).\nThe path is not left on halt or stop (MC_GroupHalt/MC_GroupStop).\nThe path is not left on interrupt or continue\n(MC_GroupInterrupt/MC_GroupContinue).\nThe acceleration, constant velocity, and deceleration phase for\nall axes begins and ends at the same time.\nNote\nThe velocity/acc-/deceleration/jerk limits of each axis are properties\nof each axis and not specified within this function block.\nSee also inputs\nVelFactor\n,\nAccFactor\nand\nJerkFactor\n.\nThe transition mode TMCornerDistance is only supported if the start-\nand end-position of the movement are given in the ACS.  Otherwise,\nan error is reported.\nThe following example shows the behaviour of\nMC_MoveDirectRelative\n.\nAll positions are related to the MCS:\nStarting at position p0 (10; 10) a\nMC_MoveLinearAbsolute\nto position\np1 (80; 35) is commanded.\nWhile the TCP is moving towards p1, the\nMC_MoveLinearAbsolute\ncommand\nis aborted by a\nMC_MoveDirectRelative\ncommand. The actual position of\nthe TCP, when\nMC_MoveDirectRelative\nbecomes active, is (44.5; 21.63).\nThe TCP leaves the line p0 .. p1 and moves to the new target position\np2 (54.5; 41.63). The resulting trajectory depends on the kinematic\ntransformation of the axis group.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetRemoveListElement :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an Remove-List-Element request\nSends a request to remove one or more list elements from an object property which\nis a list. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation,\nand timeout for both request and in response. This routine can execute asynchronously,\ni.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so\nthat the applications can keep running. In this case the response information will be\nreceived by the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_CHANGE_LIST_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If the application does not supply the BACNET_CHANGE_LIST_COMPLETE_CB routine\nthen the BACnetRemoveListElement routine sends a request and waits for the reply.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_AxisDiagnosticLog\nThis function block is designed for writing cyclically a set of parameter values belonging to one axis to a file.\nThis output file is ideal for diagnosis purposes.\nAs the writing of data on a data medium usually needs some time, this module stores the collected data in a buffer\nof size 10 kByte and the data will not be written until module action\nWriteToFile\nis called.\nThis action call should be placed in a slower (ca. 50 ms) task of lower priority, in order to prevent the actual\nmotion task as well as the motion itself from being disturbed. As soon as the buffer is exceeded, the module will\ncreate an error output.\n",

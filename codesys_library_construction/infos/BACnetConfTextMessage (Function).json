  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetConfTextMessage :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an confirmed TextMessage.\nSends a request to transmit a text to the remote device. Message may be prioritized\ninto Normal or Urgent categories. In addition, a text message may be optionally\nclassified by a numeric class code or class identification string. The interpretation\nof the class is a local matter. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU\nlength, segmentation, and timeout, for both request and response. This routine can\nexecute asynchronously, so this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet\nreply is received so that the applications keeps running. In this case the response\ninformation will be received by the thread which is responsible for receiving\nasynchronous responses. An optional BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine,\nwhich has to be provided by the BACnet application, will be used to process this information.\nIf a number of asynchronous requests are sent, the responses will be queued and\nidentified by the transaction handles. If application does not supply the\nBACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, then this routine sends a request and waits\nfor reply.\n",

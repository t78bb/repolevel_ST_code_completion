  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_GearInPos\nMC_GearInPos\ncouples the slave axis to the master axis taking into\naccount a specific positional relationship.\nImportant\nIn certain cases, it may be impossible to avoid a reversal of the slave.\n(Even if the slave velocity is not opposite to the master.)\nOne example is a slave with a small positive velocity and a large\nnegative acceleration. It may not be possible to ramp down the\nacceleration fast enough to prevent the velocity from becoming negative.\nNote\nMC_GearInPos\nshould be called after the motion FB controlling\nthe\nMaster\naxis has been called.  Otherwise, the\nSlave\naxis\nwill lag behind the\nMaster\naxis.\nTiming diagram\nWith\nBufferMode\nAborting, any previous motion is continued until the\nmaster crosses the position\nMasterSyncPosition\nâ\nMasterStartDistance\nin the correct direction.\nAt that point in time the output\nStartSync\nis set. When a stop\ncommand is executed on the slave axis before the synchronization\nhas happened, it will inhibit the synchronization and the function block\nissues\nCommandAborted\n=\nTRUE\n.\nIf the\nMasterStartDistance\nis not specified (indicated by a non-positive\nvalue), the function block calculates the setting start distancepoint so\nthat synchronization starts at the current master position.\nWith\nBufferMode\nBuffered or BlendingPrevious, the input\nMasterStartDistance\ncannot be provided (i.e. must be set to 0).\nThe reason for this is that as soon as the previous movement finished,\nMC_GearInPos must take over the axis and continue the movement, it cannot\nwait until the master sync position has been reached.\n(If the master is in standstill when the previous movement is finished,\nthen an error\nSMC_GIP_CANNOT_START_SYNC\nis reported.)\nTiming Diagram of\nMC_GearInPos\nÂ¶\nDifferent examples of gearing\nÂ¶\n",

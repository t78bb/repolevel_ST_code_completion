  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FINAL SMC_NCDecoder\nThis function block is used to convert a CNC program (Din 66025, G-code),\ninto a list of\nSMC_GEOINFO\nobjects.\nIn each cycle, one line of the program is decoded.\nNote\nThe maximum number of M-functions in a row is 64.\nIf the G-Code contains more than 64 M-functions in a row,\nthe error\nSMC_DEC_OUTQUEUE_RAN_EMPTY\noccurs.\nThis restriction can be circumvented by inserting a G75\nprevious to the first M-function of the sequence.\nG4-elements count as M-functions, too.\nNote\nAs from V3.5 SP2 of the programming system,\niLineNumberDecoded\nstores the just coded 0-based line number of the CNC file.\nIn earlier versions, in particular CODESYS V2.3, the sentence number\n(= value of the N-word) had been stored there.\nNote\nThis function block has been superseeded by\nSMC_NCInterpreter\nand is kept only for compatibility.  It is recommended to use\nSMC_NCInterpreter\n(along with\nSMC_ReadNCFile2\n), which has additional\nfeatures like mathematical expressions or sub programs in g-code\n",

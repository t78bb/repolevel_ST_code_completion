  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_Phasing\nMC_Phasing\nprovides a constant phase shift between master and slave axis.\nMC_Phasing\nwill abort any ongoing movement of the slave axis.\nIn this respect, it differs from the function blocks\nMC_PhasingAbsolute\nand\nMC_PhasingRelative\ndefined by the PLCopen for Motion Control 2.0\nstandard.\nThese function blocks donât abort an ongoing slave movement but superimpose\nthe phase shift on top of e.g. an ongoing\nMC_CamIn\nor\nMC_GearIn\nmovement.\nTo achieve this behavior with\nMC_Phasing\n, please use an additional\nvirtual axis as the slave axis of\nMC_Phasing\nand use this virtual\nslave as the master for\nMC_CamIn\nor\nMC_GearIn\n.\nAlternatively,\nMC_MoveSuperimposed\ncan be used on the master axis of\nan\nMC_CamIn\nor\nMC_GearIn\nmovement.\nImportant\nPhase\n,\nVelocity\n,\nAcceleration\nand\nDeceleration\nof a phase shift are controlled by the function block.\nNote\nMC_Phasing\nshould be called after the motion FB controlling\nthe\nMaster\naxis has been called.  Otherwise, the\nSlave\naxis\nwill lag behind the\nMaster\naxis.\nTiming example of\nMC_Phasing\nTiming of\nMC_Phasing\nÂ¶\nExample demonstrating the effect of\nMC_Phasing\nDemonstrating the effect of\nMC_Phasing\nÂ¶\n",

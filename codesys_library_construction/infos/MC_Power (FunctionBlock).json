If an error is detected, the state of the axis is set to\nerrorstop\n.\nIf the inputs\nEnable\n,\nbRegulatorOn\nand\nbDriveStart\nare\nTRUE\nbut the output\nStatus\nremains\nFALSE\nfor a long time,\na possible reason is a hardware problem with the power stage of the\ndrive.\nIf power fails (also during operation),\nnAxisState\nof the\nreferenced axis is set to\nerrorstop\n.\nFor encoder axes, such as\nFREE_ENCODER_REF\nor an encoder axis below\na drive, calling\nMC_Power\nis not necessary.\nIf called on an encoder axis, MC_Power has no effect on the\naxis and the output\nStatus\nremains\nFALSE\n.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK MC_TrackRotaryTable\nThis function block tracks a piece on a rotary table.\nBased on the position and orientation of the rotary table\nand on the position and orientation of the piece relative to the\ntable, the tracking is performed using\nSMC_SetDynCoordTransformEx\n.\nThe rotation, angular velocity, etc. of the rotary table is given by a\nsingle axis.\nThis FB may be called with a new rising edge on Execute only after the\nconfigured dynamic coordinate system is no longer in use by any movement,\notherwise error SMC_AXIS_GROUP_PCS_STILL_IN_USE will be returned.\nSee output\nInUse\n.\nNote\nNo dead time compensation is done. In case the axis is an encoder,\nit is recommended to use a logical axis to account for the dead time.\nSee also\nMC_TrackConveyorBelt\n.\nThe function block\nSMC_SetDynCoordTransformEx\nprovides a more\ngeneral interface.\nThis FB does not start a movement (administrative FB). The movement is\ninitiated by a command in PCS.\n",

  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetLifeSafetyOperation :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends a LifeSafetyOperation request.\nSends the requests to provide a mechanism for transporting specific instructions from an\noperator to silence, audible or visual notification appliances or reset\nnotification appliances. This service may be used in fire, life safety and security\nsystems. Because the present version of this BACnet API does not support a default processing\nfor this service, the destination has to include a Hook procedure to process it. This\nroutine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation and timeout for both\nrequests and responses. This routine can execute asynchronously, so this routine will\nreturn to the caller before the BACnet reply is received so that the application keeps\nrunning. In this case the response information will be received by the thread that\nis responsible for receiving asynchronous responses. An optional\nBACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, which has to be provided by the BACnet application,\nshall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous requests are\nsent, the responses will be queued and identified by their transaction handles. If the\napplication does not supply the BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, then this\nroutine sends a request and waits for reply.\nreturn IEC_BACNET_STATUS\n",

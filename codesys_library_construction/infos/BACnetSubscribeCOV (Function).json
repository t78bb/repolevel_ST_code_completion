  "text": "\nFUNCTION BACnetSubscribeCOV :\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nSends an SubscribeCov request\nSends a message to subscribe a COV client to receive COV notifications from a BACnet\nstandard object, or cancel the existing subscription. If the standard object supports\nCOV reporting, COV notification may be sent to one or more subscriber clients. A\nsubscription establishes a connection between the change of value detection and\nreporting mechanism within the COV-server device, and a logical Process within a\nCOV-client. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length, segmentation,\nand timeout for both request and in response. This routine can execute asynchronously,\ni.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply comes so\nthat the applications can keep running. In this case the response information will be\nreceived by the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the BACnet\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If the application does not supply the BACNET_SIMPLE_ACK_COMPLETE_CB routine\nthen the BACnetSubscribeCOV routine sends a request and waits for the reply.\n",

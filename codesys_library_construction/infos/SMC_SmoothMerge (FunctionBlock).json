  "text": "\nFUNCTION_BLOCK SMC_SmoothMerge\nThe function block serves the preprocessing of line segments supplied by a CAD/CAM\nsystem. It is executed after decoding. It tries to approximate a\nmaximum number of points by a polynom. The deviation from the original path must be\nwithin a given threshold. The created elements can be smoothed by use of the SMC_SmoothPath\nfunction block.\nIn each cycle this function block appends a maximum of one element to the out-queue.\nExactly one element is appended if the in-queue is full or\nbEndOfList\nis active and\nthe out-queue is not full. The look-ahead is therefore limited by the size of the\nin-queue. Only movements in X, Y, Z, A, B and C are considered.\nThe function block uses the mean-square-best-approximation, but always pass exactly\nthrough one first point (for avoiding jumps). This first point is given by the\npiDestPos\nof the last generated element. If it is the first element that we deal with, this is its\npiStartPos\n.\nOnly the following movement types can be merged:\nAll G01 movements\nG00 movements without movement in X/Y/Z direction\nEvery other movement type or without the required feature flag will just\nbe forwarded to the out-queue, except for one case:\nThe first element after a merging block is going to be converted into a line,\nexcept for administrative (i.e. M-function, G4 etc.) and G00 elements.\nNote\nThe function block\ndoes only merge the additional axes A/B/C (P/Q/U/V/W are not considered)\ndoes not support h-functions\ndoes not support changes of flags like G51, G52, G40 and so on. These changes are\nignored.\ntakes at most 128 line segments into account (as this quantity influences both\nperformance and storage size).\ndoes not support probe movements / G31.\nA spline always contains the same tool correction information\n(i.e. lengths and diameter) as the first of the segments\nthat it replaces.\n",

of type Analog Output.\nAn instance of AnalogOutput does represent an combination of an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 40 âanalog output statusâ\nand optionally an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 41 âanalog outputsâ.\nAnalogOutput allows for DNP3 master read access and - if needed / configured - also for âcommandingâ that means DNP3 acknowledged master write access (select / operate).\nTo enable âcommandingâ (in fact the instance of DNP3 object group 41 âanalog outputsâ) set EnableCommand to TRUE.\nDNP3 Analog Output provides the option to use certain data types to represent the value (using AnyNumber):\nSINT (8bit -128 .. 127)\nUSINT (16bit 0 .. 255)\nINT (16bit -32768 .. 32767)\nUINT (16bit 0 .. 65535)\nDINT (32bit -2147483648 .. 2147483647)\nUDINT (32bit 0 .. 4294967295)\nREAL\nDOUBLE\nAny one of the types listed can be used for value, lowLimit, highLimit and deadBand,\nall variables have to be of same base type.\nPlease be aware:\nAnyNumber\nprovides a value representation as well as a POINTER TO value representation.\nInOut:\nScope\nName\nType\nInitial\nComment\nInherited from\nInput\nDescription\nSTRING\nDescription of the datapoint - this is a configuration,\nchanges are ignored after Outstation was enabled.\nPoint\nNumber\nDINT\n-1\nPoint number - this is a configuration, changes are ignored after Outstation was enabled..\nThe point number can be configured if needed to either:\nstart with Point number > 0\nhave gaps in Point numbers\nIf set to -1 (the default) the OutstationDataModel (more precisely the related âGroupâ) takes care to set the Point number internally:\nstarting at 0, if first Point number is not set explicitly.\nincrement by 1\nIn case you set Point number explicitly please keep it consistent:\nPoint numbers need to be >= 0\nPoint numbers need to be ascending\nPoint\nEventClass\nUSINT\nConstants.TMWDEFS_CLASS_MASK_ONE\nThe initial event class - this is a configuration, changes are ignored after Outstation was enabled.\nOperational event class may be changed by a master.\nPoint\nEventMode\nPointEventMode\nPointEventMode.EVENT_MODE_SOE\nThe event mode - this is a configuration, changes are ignored after Outstation was enabled.\nOnly used if the sampling rate is set within the outstation configuration.\nPoint\ntScanPeriod\nTIME\nTIME#0ms\nScan period for datapoint.\nIf tScanPeriod is set to T#0MS, the Group related tScanPeriod or the OutstationDataModel.tScanPeriod is used.\nPoint\nudiLogOptions\nUDINT\nOutstationLoggingOptions.None\nLoggingOptions

the point.

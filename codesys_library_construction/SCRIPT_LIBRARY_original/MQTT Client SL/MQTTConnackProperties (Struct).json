Identifier: If the Client connects using a zero length Client Identifier,\nthe Server MUST respond with a CONNACK containing an Assigned Client Identifier.\nuiServerKeepAlive\nUINT\nThe Keep Alive is a time interval measured in seconds.\nIt is the maximum time interval that is permitted to elapse between the point at\nwhich the Client finishes transmitting one MQTT Control Packet and the point it starts sending the next.\nThe server Keep Alive interval overwrites the value of the input tPingInterval.\nxAuthPacketReceived\nBOOL\nTRUE, if a AUTH Packet has been received.\nThe data is stored in wsAuthenticationMethod, bAuthenticationData and udiAuthenticationDataSize.\nThe ReasonCode is stored in MQTTClient.eReaonCode.\nThe response to the server can be send via the method MQTTClient.SendAuth().\nwsAuthenticationMethod\nWSTRING\nName of the authentication method\nbAuthenticationData\nARRAY\n[0..MQTTParam.g_udiMaxAuthDataSize]\nOF BYTE\nBinary Data containing authentication data\nudiAuthenticationDataSize\nUDINT\nSize of pbAuthenticationData\nwsResponseInformation\nWSTRING\nBasis for Response Topics.\nwsServerReference\nWSTRING\nString which can be used to identify another Server to use.\nThe Server uses a Server Reference in either a CONNACK or DISCONNECT packet with Reason code\nof 0x9C (Use another server) or Reason Code 0x9D (Server moved).\nwsReasonString\nWSTRING\nString representing the reason for the disconnect.\nuiReceiveMaximum\nUINT\nThe Server uses this value to limit the number of QoS 1 and QoS 2 publications that it is willing to\nprocess concurrently for the Client.\nuiTopicAliasMaximum\nUINT\nThe maximum value of topic aliases.\nbMaximumQoS\nBYTE\nMaximum allowed QoS of the server.\nA value of 255 means that the value has not been set.\nbRetainAvailable\nBYTE\nRetain Available: A  value of 0 means that retained messages are not supported.\nA value of 1 means retained messages are supported.\nA value of 255 means that the value has not been set.\nudiMaximumPacketSize\nUDINT\nMaximum packet size of the server\nA value of 0 means that the value has not been set.\nbWildcardSubscriptionAvailable\nBYTE\nWildcard Subscription Available: A value is 0 means that Wildcard Subscriptions are not supported.\nA value of 1 means Wildcard Subscriptions are supported.\nA value of 255 means that the value has not been set.\nbSubscriptionIdentifierAvailable\nBYTE\nSubscription Identifiers Available: A value is 0 means that Subscription Identifiers are not supported.\nA value of 1 means Subscription Identifiers are supported.\nA value of 255 means that the value has not been set.\nbSharedSubscriptionAvailable\nBYTE\nShared Subscription Available: A value of 1 means Shared 1356 Subscriptions are supported.\nIf not present, then Shared Subscriptions are supported.\nA value of 255 means that the value has not been

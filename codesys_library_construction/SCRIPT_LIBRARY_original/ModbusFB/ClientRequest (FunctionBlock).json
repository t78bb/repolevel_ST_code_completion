udiTimeout in Âµs) to avoid endless, effectless client operations.\nSo in general the application should:\n- trigger the request with rising edge on xExecute (set xExecute:=TRUE)\n- check if request is done (xDone=TRUE) or error occured (xError=TRUE)\n- falling edge on xExecute (set xExecute:=FALSE)\n- eventually repeat\nClient request errors and timeout\nÂ¶\nA client request can fail (xError=TRUE) for different reason:\nâexception replyâ - the server is answering in time, but signals an invalid request.\nIn this case eErrorID is set to Error.RequestException and eException contains the specific exception code.\nThis is kind of a normal reply a server can do, because of client request parameters not valid for the server âdata modelâ.\nâreply timeoutâ - the server is not answering in time (udiReplyTimeout - for consistency to CBML.ETrigTo.udiTimeout in Âµs as well).\nThis includes incomplete (frames) or invalid replies which are dropped, but does not include âexception repliesâ.\nIn this case eErrorID is set to Error.ReplyTimeout.\nIn general the application canât do a lot about this type of error except choosing adequate udiReplyTimeout.\nârequest starvationâ - too many client requests triggered in parallel, causing a timeout (see udiTimeout) before server reply or âreply timeoutâ happens.\nIn this case eErrorID is set to Error.RequestNotProcessed.\nIn general the application is responsible to avoid ârequest starvationâ.\nThe client does process the client requests as fast as possible, but in sequential order.\nProcessing one client request involves waiting for the server reply to be processed (including eventual âreply timeoutâ).\nIn case a number of client requests are triggered in parallel,\nprocessing time and waiting sums up for the subsequent client requests triggered already, but not processed yet.\nBecause ârequest starvationâ can not be avoided in general, it is recommended to trigger client requests in âdaisy chainsâ\n(first client request xDone=TRUE or xError=TRUE triggering second client request) to avoid client ârequest starvationâ at all.\nClient request errors and connection shutdown\nÂ¶\nIn case of a client request there is no other action on client involved - the client connection stays alive.\nIn case there is a need to disconnect the client (shutdown the client connection either TCP or serial)\non such a single client request error, this has to be done in the application by setting client.xConnect:=FALSE.\nTimeout default\nÂ¶\nIt is not possible to overload member defaults of base classes in IEC61131.\nCBML.ETrigTo defaults udiTimeout to 0 which is not optimal for ClientRequestâs\nbecause itâs state machine would get stuck without timeout on âreply timeoutâ or ârequest starvationâ.\nSo ClientRequest.fb_init writes udiTimeout to 2s (in Âµs) initially.\nIn case you want to chose another udiTimeout you need to assign it explicitly after initializaton (in a PLC application cycle).\nâdata itemâ offset / âdata itemâ numbers\nÂ¶\nPlease note: unlike standard MODBUS, in CODESYS MODBUS the âdata itemâ numbers are equal to the âdata addressesâ.\nThe MODBUS standard states: âIn the MODBUS data Model each element within a data block is numbered from 1 to n.â\nIn CODESYS MODBUS the âdata itemsâ are numbered from 0 to n-1.\nInOut:\nScope\nName\nType\nInitial\nComment\nInherited from\nInput\nxExecute\nBOOL\nRising edge: Starts defined operation\nFALSE\n: Resets the defined operation after ready condition was reached\nETrigTo\nudiTimeOut\nUDINT\nMax. operating time for executing\n[Âµs], 0: No operating time limit\nETrigTo\nOutput\nxDone\nBOOL\nReady condition reached\nETrigTo\nxBusy\nBOOL\nOperation is running\nETrigTo\nxError\nBOOL\nError condition reached\nETrigTo\nInout\nrClient\nClient\nReference to\nClient\n.\nInput\nuiUnitId\nUINT\n0\nUnit-Id to send the request to.\nudiReplyTimeout\nUDINT\n(50 * 1000)\nReply timeout in Âµs -

FALSE: Safety\nsensor in test state or demand for safety-related response.\nTRUE: Sensor in the state for normal operating conditions.\nStartTest\nBOOL\nFALSE\nInput to start sensor test. Sets âS_TestOutâ and starts the\ninternal time monitoring function in the FB. FALSE: No test\nrequested. TRUE: Test requested.\nTestTime\nTIME\nTIME#10ms\nTest time of safety sensor. Range from 0 to 150ms.\nNoExternalTest\nBOOL\nFALSE\nIndicates if external manual sensor test is supported. FALSE: The external manual sensor test is supported.\nOnly after a complete manual sensor switching sequence, a automatic test is possible again after a faulty automatic sensor test.\nTRUE: The external manual sensor test is not supported. An automatic test is possible again without a manual sensor switch-ing sequence after faulty automatic sensor test.\nS_StartReset\nBOOL\nFALSE\nStart behaviour of safety FB\nS_AutoReset\nBOOL\nFALSE\nBehaviour on error of safety FB\nReset\nBOOL\nFALSE\nManual reset of FB\nOutput\nReady\nBOOL\nFALSE\nActivation of the FB. TRUE indicates that the FB is\nactivated and the outputs results are valid, FALSE the FB is\nnot active and the program is not executed.\nS_OSSD_Out\nBOOL\nFALSE\nSafety related output indicating the status of the ESPE.\nFALSE: The sensor has a safety-related action request or\ntest error. TRUE: The sensor has no safety-related action\nrequest AND no test error.\nS_TestOut\nBOOL\nFALSE\nCoupled with the test input of the sensor. Although specified as SAFEBOOL, in practice this signal will often be connected to a BOOL output.\nFALSE: Test request issued. TRUE: No test request.\nTestPossible\nBOOL\nFALSE\nFeedback signal to the process. FALSE: An automatic sensor\ntest is not possible. TRUE: An automatic sensor test is\npossible.\nTestExecuted\nBOOL\nFALSE\nA positive signal edge indicates the successful execution of the au-tomatic sensor test.\nFALSE: An automatic sensor test was not executed yet or an automatic sensor test is active or an automatic sensor test was faulty.\nTRUE: A sensor test was executed successfully.\nSafetyDemand\nBOOL\nFALSE\nOutput indicating that the FB is active and the primary\nsafety function is demanded (e.g. related to the safety\nfunctionality).\nResetRequest\nBOOL\nFALSE\nOutput which can be used to signal the operator to press the\nreset functionality to continue.\nError\nBOOL\nFALSE\nError flag\nDiagCode\nWORD\n0\nDiagnostic register",

This routine may read a single property of a single object, a list of\nproperties of a single object, or any number of properties of any number of objects\nwithin one device. This routine may control APDU properties like APDU length,\nsegmentation, and timeout for both request and response. This routine can execute\nasynchronously, i.e. this routine will return to the caller before the BACnet reply\ncomes so that the applications can keep running. In this case the response information\nwill be received by the thread which is responsible for receiving asynchronous responses.\nAn optional BACNET_READ_PROP_MUL_COMPLETE_CB routine, which is provided by the\napplication, shall be used to process this information. If a number of asynchronous\nrequests are sent, the responses shall be queued and identified by the transaction\nhandles. If the application does not supply the BACNET_READ_PROP_MUL_COMPLETE_CB routine\nthen the BACnetReadPropertyMultiple routine sends a request and waits for the reply.\nAsynchron call, which fills readAccessResult with the call result in an asynchronus manner. As soon as pContentsStatus\nis\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS.BACNET_STATUS_OK\nthe data in pContents is valid.\nInOut:\nScope\nName\nType\nComment\nReturn\nBACnetReadPropertyMultiple\nIEC_BACNET_STATUS\nA status indicating if the operation worked.\nInput\npSourceAddress\nPOINTER TO\nIEC_BACNET_ADDRESS\nIf the BACnet application has only one device constructed and installed, this can\nbe 0. In this case the MAC address of this device will be used. Otherwise this\nshall be the MAC address returned on device object construction.\npDestinationAddress\nPOINTER TO\nIEC_BACNET_ADDRESS\nThis is the MAC address of the device to which the request\nshould be sent.\npRpmInfo\nPOINTER TO\nIEC_BACNET_READ_MUL_INFO\nA pointer to the service information data structure.\npAPDUParams\nPOINTER TO\nIEC_BACNET_APDU_PROPERTIES\nA pointer to the APDU-Properties structure which sets APDU properties for this\ntransaction only. This does not change global defaults or settings for the application\nAPDU Properties. This argument may be 0. In this case APDU properties  are used\nwhich were specified in the device object properties of the applications device which\nsends the request.\npReadAccessResult\nPOINTER TO\nIEC_BACNET_READ_RAW_RESULT_LIST\nA pointer to the memory block to place a list of one or more\nIEC_BACNET_READ_RAW_RESULT_LIST\ndata structures which indicate success or failure of the\nreading of each specified Property. In the case of successful access to a single\nProperty, its value shall be returned within this argument, and in the case of access\nfailure this argument shall convey the Property Access Error information. The\napplication may initialize the readRes member of the\nIEC_BACNET_READ_RAW_RESULT_LIST\nstructure with a 0 pointer and setting the nListCount to 0 too. In this case the\nmemory for the response is allocated by the API and the application is responsible to\nrelease it with a call to\nBACnetFreeStackAllocatedMemory\nif the buffer is no longer\nneeded.\npTransactionToken\nPOINTER TO\nBACnetAsyncTransactionToken\nTransaction token of the asynchronous call - see\nBACnetAsyncTransactionToken\n.\npError\nPOINTER TO\nIEC_BACNET_ERROR\nA pointer to a structure to hold BACnet Error information. pError may be 0 if the\napplication isnât interested in detailed error information.\ntop\nCODESYS Group | We\nsoftware\nAutomation.\nto software\n['sɒftwɛər]\ntransitive verb\n__softwared/softwaring\n: to develop software\n// to software automation: to develop software for automation purposes\nThe CODESYS Group is the manufacturer of CODESYS, the leading hardware-independent\n                                    IEC 61131-3 automation software for developing and engineering controller\n                                    applications.\nCODESYS® is a registered trademark.\nCODESYS GmbH\nA member of the CODESYS Group\nMemminger Straße 151, 87439 Kempten\nGermany\nTel.:\n+49-831-54031-0\ninfo@codesys.com\nLegal Notice\nPrivacy Policy\nLinkedIn\nYoutube\nRSS\nDownloads\nLogin\nCODESYS Store\n© 2022 CODESYS GmbH\n| A member of the CODESYS Group",

of type Binary Output.\nAn instance of BinaryOutput does represent an combination of an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 10 âbinary outputsâ\nand optionally an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 12 âbinary output commandsâ.\nBinaryOutput allows for DNP3 master read access and - if needed / configured - also for âcommandingâ that means DNP3 acknowledged master write access (select / operate).\nTo enable âcommandingâ (in fact the instance of DNP3 object group 12 âbinary output commandsâ) set EnableCommand to TRUE.\nIf configured BinaryOutput also allows for DNP3 direct master write - which is not recommended by DNP3 standard anyway.\nTo enable DNP3 direct master write set enableWrite to TRUE.\nBinaryOutput implements the âcontrol modelâ called âb - complementary latch modelâ.\nInOut:\nScope\nName\nType\nInitial\nComment\nInherited from\nInput\nDescription\nSTRING\nDescription of the datapoint - this is a configuration,\nchanges

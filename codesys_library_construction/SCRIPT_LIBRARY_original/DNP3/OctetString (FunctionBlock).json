String.\nAn instance of AnalogInput does represent an instance of a datapoint of DNP3 object group 110 âoctet stringsâ.\nPlease be aware, that - as opposed to other DNP3 object group definitions - an instance of DNP3 object group 110 âoctet stringsâ\nallows for DNP3 master read / write access. Master write access can be disabled using enableWrite.\nIn contrast to all other DNP3 object groups which support command / write,\na datapoint DNP3 object group 110 âoctet stringsâ is meant to write to the same memory than to read from.\nThis may not be practical within a PLC application, most obviously because the write will happen from another task context (the low level DNP3 stack) without any synchronization\nwith your IEC application. So OctetString distinguishes between memory to read from and memory to write to.\nIn case master write access is enabled (enableWrite=TRUE),\npBufOut/pLengthOut is written by a master write operation, thus signaled by writeActive.\nAn active master write can be reset using resetWrite, thus setting pLengthOut^ to 0.\nInOut:\nScope\nName\nType\nInitial\nComment\nInherited from\nInput\nDescription\nSTRING\nDescription of the datapoint - this is a configuration,\nchanges are ignored after Outstation was enabled.\nPoint\nNumber\nDINT\n-1\nPoint number - this is a configuration, changes are ignored after Outstation was enabled..\nThe point number can be configured if needed to either:\nstart with Point number > 0\nhave gaps in Point numbers\nIf set to -1 (the default) the OutstationDataModel (more precisely the related âGroupâ) takes care to set the Point number internally:\nstarting at 0, if first Point number is not set explicitly.\nincrement by 1\nIn case you set Point number explicitly please keep it consistent:\nPoint numbers need to be >= 0\nPoint numbers need to be ascending\nPoint\nEventClass\nUSINT\nConstants.TMWDEFS_CLASS_MASK_ONE\nThe initial event class - this is a configuration, changes are ignored after Outstation was enabled.\nOperational event class may be changed by a master.\nPoint\nEventMode\nPointEventMode\nPointEventMode.EVENT_MODE_SOE\nThe event mode - this is a configuration, changes are ignored after Outstation was enabled.\nOnly used if the sampling rate is set within the outstation configuration.\nPoint\ntScanPeriod\nTIME\nTIME#0ms\nScan period for datapoint.\nIf tScanPeriod is set to T#0MS, the Group related tScanPeriod or the OutstationDataModel.tScanPeriod is used.\nPoint\nudiLogOptions\nUDINT\nOutstationLoggingOptions.None\nLoggingOptions can be combined using OR.\nPoint\nOutput\nxError\nBOOL\nAn error occured.\nPoint\neErrorID\nError\nThe specific error.\nPoint\nInput\npBufIn\nPOINTER TO BYTE\nPointer to input buffer.\nmaxLengthIn\nUSINT\n0\nMaximum length of input buffer.\nlengthIn\nUSINT\nLength of input buffer.\nenableWrite\nBOOL\nFALSE\nEnable / disable master write.\npBufOut\nPOINTER TO BYTE\n0\nPointer to output buffer.\nmaxLengthOut\nUSINT\n0\nMaximum length of output buffer.\npLengthOut\nPOINTER TO USINT\n0\nPointer to location into which to store the output buffer\nlength.\nresetWrite\nBOOL\nFALSE\nReset an active master write at rising edge (FALSE â>\nTRUE).\nOutput\nwriteActive\nBOOL\nA master write was accepted and is active right now.\nProperties:\nPointNum\n, inherited from\nPoint\nPointTyp\n, inherited from\nPoint\nMethods:\nGetDescriptionString\n, inherited from\nPoint\nIdentificationToString\n, inherited from\nPoint\nToString\n, inherited from\nPoint",

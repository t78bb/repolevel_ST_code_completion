It seems like you've shared fragments of code from a repository, specifically related to a `FUNCTION_BLOCK` named `fileSave`. This block appears to handle file operations such as writing data to a file, managing file handles, and closing files. However, the last fragment seems to be incomplete. Could you clarify your question or provide more context about what you're trying to achieve or understand?
